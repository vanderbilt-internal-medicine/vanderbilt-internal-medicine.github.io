## tricks

### Cleaning up old orders

_Shout out to the BMT nurses for showing me this trick_

Some folks have literally years
of old nursing orders and administrative mumbo jumbo
in their orders tab that is not only useless,
it is dangerous, because it makes it harder for everyone
(nurses included) to see current, relevant orders.

Cleaning out old orders is easy.
Highlight all the orders you want
(CTRL-click is better than SHIFT-click,
bc you can drag a CTRL-click and skip some,
then drag some more),
right click,
select "Discontinue,"
then click "Duplicate Order."

After you sign these,
they should disappear from the chart immediately.

Oddities:

For some reason,
no orders from 2008 or earlier are able to be deleted.
If you figure out how to fix this, let me know.

Most old "pending" lab orders can be deleted,
but "active" ones (even if super old)
stick around like peanut butter stains.

## orders of much consternation

- Coombs/DAT: (not in Lab Tests...) Blood Bank Orders (VBECS) -> Blood Bank Orders -> Diagnostic Tests -> Direct Antiglobulin Test
- topical TXA: Meds: Inpatient ->  tranexamic acid inj -> the option that says \*VL\*, also specify topical in the comments (thanks inpt pharm!)
- procedure service: not available at the VA
