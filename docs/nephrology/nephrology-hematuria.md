# Hematuria

Hematuria – Laura Binari/Patrick Steadman

Background

-   Definition
    :
    3 urinalyses with three or more RBC/hpf; 1 urinalysis with 100
    RBC/hpf or g
    ross hematuria (1 cc blood/L urine can induce color change)
-   Can be transient (exercise-induced, menses, trauma)
-   Hemoglobinuria: Hgb should be found only in intact RBCs, presence in
    urine suggests intravascular hemolysis AND fully saturated
    haptoglobin sites in serum
-   Myoglobinuria: should be found only in intact muscle, presence in
    urine suggests myonecrosis (serum haptoglobin has LOW affinity for
    myoglobin)
-   Concurrent pyuria/dysuria: consider urinary tract infection or
    bladder malignancy
-   Recent URI: think infection related glomerulonephritis, IgA,
    vasculitis, anti-GBM
-   Positive Family Hx of Hematuria: consider PKD, Sickle Cell Disease
-   Bleeding from other sites: think inherited/acquired bleeding
    disorder, anticoagulation
-   Unilateral Flank Pain: Ureteral calculus, renal malignancy, IgA
    Nephropathy
-   Microscopic hematuria
    – should be considered for CT Urography and cystoscopy
-   Malignancy Risk Factors: male sex, age > 35, smoking Hx, exposures
    to benzene/aromatic amine, cyclophosphamide, indwelling foreign
    body, pelvis irradiation, chronic UTIs, h/o heavy NSAID use, h/o
    urologic disorders/disease (nephrolithiasis, BPH)

Evaluation

-   Step 1: Confirm the presence of hematuria
    -   Dipstick positive heme: urinary RBCs (hematuria), free myoglobin
        or free hemoglobin
    -   Centrifuge the urine
        -   -   Red sediment -> true hematuria (urinary RBCs)
            -   Red supernatant +

<!-- -->

-   -   Positive dipstick: myoglobulin or hemoglobin
    -   Negative dipstick porphyria, Pyridium, beets, rhubarb, or
        ingestion of food dyes

-   Step 2: Determine if there is a GLOMERULAR or NON-GLOMERULAR source
    of bleeding

| Proteinuria                | May be \> 500 mg/day    | \< 500 mg/day       |
| RBC Morphology             | Dysmorphic RBCs present | Normal (isomorphic) |
| RBC Casts                  | May be Present          | Absent              |

-   -   Glomerular Bleeding:
        -   -   Isolated Hematuria: Differential includes IgA
                Nephropathy, thin BM dx, Alport’s
            -   Nephritic syndrome (new proteinuria, pyuria, HTN, edema,
                rise in Cr): post-infectious GN, MPGN, ANCA vasculitis,
                Goodpasture’s, lupus nephritis
            -   Workup: anti-GMB, anti-DNase/ASO, ANA, ANCA, C3, C4,
                cryo, Hep B & C, HIV
            -   Indications for Renal Biopsy: glomerular bleeding + risk
                factors for progressive disease, including albuminuria >
                30 mg/day, new hypertension > 140/90 or significant
                elevation over baseline BP, rise in serum creatinine
    -   Extraglomerular Bleeding (Imaging Section)
        -   -   If historical clues suggest nephrolithiasis, start with
                non-con CT A/P
            -   Gross Hematuria otherwise should be evaluated with CT
                A/P w/ and w/o contrast (CT urography); consult urology
                for cystoscopy (often done as outpatient referral)
            -   If clots are passed, more likely to be secondary to
                lower urinary source, and if a high burden of clots
                poses a risk of obstruction (urologic emergency)
            -   If extraglomerular bleeding with clots: hematuria
                catheter needs to be placed ASAP (2 valve catheter,
                20-24 Fr (!); page urology if nursing unable to obtain)
    -   CT Urography is more sensitive than IV pyelogram for renal
        masses and stones.
    -   Prefer Renal and Bladder Ultrasound in pregnant patients
    -   All pts w/gross hematuria that is non-glomerular in source, in
        whom infection has been ruled out, warrant cystoscopy
        . Additionally, all patients with clots need cystoscopy
