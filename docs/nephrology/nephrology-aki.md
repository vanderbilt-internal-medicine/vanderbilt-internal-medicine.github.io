# AKI

Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) – Joseph Quintana, Mengyao Tang

Background

-   Rise
    in Creatinine (Cr) **<u>\></u> 0.3 mg/dL** within 48 hours, or
    increase **<u>\></u> 1.5 x baseline** in 7 days
    -   Oliguria = \< 0.3 mL/kg/hr or \< 500 mL/day
    -   Anuria = \< 50 mL/day
-   ACE
    -i’s and ARB’s alter the renal autoregulation and exacerbate
    pre-renal AKI
-   Acute
    Tubular Necrosis (ATN)
    and pre-renal disease comprise 66% of inpatient AKI
    -   Pre-
        renal:
        -   Fluid losses: GI, blood, Respiratory or metabolic losses
            \[fevers, tachypnea, sepsis\]
        -   Decreased
            effective intravascular volume \[HFrEF, Hepatorenal\]
        -   Afferent
            arteriole constriction \[NSAIDs, Iodinated contrast\]
    -   Intra-renal (Tubular and interstitial disease)
        :
        -   ATN =
            Most
            common
            ;
            Ischemia or nephrotoxin
        -   ACE-i + NSAIDs, ACE-i + contrast, prerenal + ACE-i,
            prerenal + NSAIDs
        -   Acute
            Interstitial
            Nephritis (AIN) usually drug-induced
        -   Other
            causes
            :
            -   Crystalline nephropathy: IV acyclovir, tumor lysis
            -   Small vessel disease: MAHA, TTP, HUS
            -   Large vessel problems: Aortic dissection, renal artery
                stenosis
            -   Glomerular disease: Nephritic pattern
    -   Post-renal (Obstruction):
        -   Ureteral: obstructing stones (B/L or one with single
            kidney), external compression
        -   Bladder: neurogenic bladder, malignancy, obstructing blood
            clot
        -   Urethra: BPH
        -   Misplaced Foley catheter

Evaluation

-   Urinalysis
    , Strict I/O’s
-   Fluid
    challenge:
    -   Improve
        w/ diuresis
        
        CHF
    -   Improve
        w/ resuscitation
        
        hypovolemia
-   Protein
    /Cr urine spot ratio
    : quantify tubular vs glomerular range proteinuria
-   Post
    Void R
    esidual bladder scan, great test, low cost, high reward
    -   Elevated PVRs = 250 cc plus
-   Who
    needs imaging (Renal U/S)?
    -   No obvious cause of AKI, unremarkable history and bland urine
    -   Abrupt oliguria or anuria
    -   High suspicion for bladder outlet obstruction (PVRs might give
        you same data)
    -   Add doppler to evaluate for renal artery stenosis (or if
        treating resistant hypertension)
-   Urine
    Electrolytes
    -   FE
        Na
        &
        FE Urea (if on diuretics): Can suggest pre-renal vs ATN
        -   Faults
            :
            validated in “fresh” **oliguric** patients (interpretation
            becomes more difficult after intervention with fluids,
            diuretics, etc.); 1% cutoff more accurate in severe AKI; Na
            <sup>+</sup> intake affects impression; one measurement may
            be inaccurate
        -   Urine sodium can be used to assess tubular avidity
            (typically urine Na > 40 in ATN and \< 20 in pre-renal; note
            these are not absolute numbers, and there can be overlap)

Management

-   Hold
    ACE-i/ARB (remember to determine plan to resume at/after discharge)
-   Avoid unnecessary nephrotoxins: antibiotics, amphotericin,
    tenofovir, chemotherapy
-   Dose
    -adjust renally cleared medications: gabapentin, cefepime, morphine,
    metformin
-   Relieve
    Obstruction: I/O cath, foley, Urostomy
    
    Urology,
    Percutaneous nephrostomy
    
    IR
-   When
    to consider Nephrology – AKI consult:
    -   Urgent indication for dialysis (see “Renal Replacement Therapy”
        below)
    -   Cr worsening over 48-72 hrs w/o clear cause
    -   Evaluate for need for dialysis in the near future
    -   Concern for acute glomerulonephritis as cause

Additional Information

-   Rhabdomyolysis:
    UA positive for blood but no RBCs on microscopy
    -   Serologic markers of muscle injury:  AST/ALT elevation with
        normal ALK Phos
        -   -   Fluids:
                Goal of 6-12 L resuscitation in first 24 hrs if pt can
                tolerate (not well studied)
            -   Traditional thought = Urine goal of 200-300 mL/hr, until
                CK \<5000
            -   Avoid calcium repletion for hypocalcemia unless
                symptomatic
-   Post
    -obstructive diuresis
    -   Monitor pt after relief of obstruction due to possibility of
        severe polyuria (>4-5 L/day)
    -   Replete fluids to prevent volume contraction and hypokalemia
    -   ½ NS to replace about 50-75% of urinary losses
    -   If pt develops hypo/hypernatremia, consider an alternative
        resuscitation fluid
    -   Monitor calcium, phosphorus and magnesium in severe
        post-obstructive diuresis
-   Iodinated
    Contrast
    :
    -   Does not need to be dialyzed; thought to be due to afferent
        arterial spasm which occurs immediately with contrast
    -   Avoid giving if you are trying to preserve kidney function in
        CKD or AKI pts
    -   No absolute cut-off in CKD, although GFR \<30 is commonly used
        as a strong contraindication and GFR 30-45 as a relative
        contraindication
    -   If there is time pre contrast you can ensure the patient is
        volume replete with isotonic fluid to decrease the risk of
        contrast nephropathy
    -   If it is an emergency, you should not delay the contrasted
        procedure (i.e. STEMI)
-   Avoid
    gadolinium contrast from MRI in any AKI or if **GFR \<30** in CKD
    given **risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis as an absolute
    contraindication** ; GFR >30 is fine
-   eGFR
    equations are based on stable kidney Fx, acute changes in Cr make it
    unreliable
