# Hypernatremia

Hypernatremia – Rebecca Choudhury, Trevor Stevens

Background

-   Definition
    = Na <sup>+</sup> >145;
    Hypernatremia is a lack of free water
-   Dehydration is both hypernatremia AND hypovolemia
-   New studies suggest there is no evidence that overcorrection of
    hypernatremia leads to adverse outcomes! Do not undertreat!
-   Common
    causes:
    Inadequate free water intake relative to solute intake (dementia,
    limited mobility, tube feeding/TPN (ICU), impaired thirst/adipsia
    from hypothalamic stroke)
-   Less common causes: Increased insensible losses, Upper GI losses,
    Na <sup>+</sup>
    overload (salt poisoning, iatrogenic from NS infusion,
    overcorrection)
    -   Renal losses: osmotic diuresis (hyperglycemia, SGLT-2
        inhibitors, urea, mannitol), central or nephrogenic diabetes
        insipidus

Presentation

-   Lethargy, irritability, confusion, esp. if chronic
-   Seizures, coma, hemorrhagic stroke, or subarachnoid hemorrhage in
    severe acute hypernatremia (typically >158)

Evaluation

-   If
    Na <sup>+</sup>
    145-150 and free water deficit \< 3L, trial free water first, and if
    no improvement perform workup as below:
-   If
    Na <sup>+</sup>
    \> 150, check serum osm, UA, urine
    Na <sup>+</sup>
    and urine osm if etiology is unclear
    -   -   UOsm >600, U
            Na <sup>+</sup>
            low (typically \<25): volume depletion
        -   UOsm >600, U
            Na <sup>+</sup>
            high (typically >100):
            Na <sup>+</sup>
            overload
        -   UOsm \< SOsm (typically \<300): DI
        -   UOsm 300-600: osmotic diuresis and/or partial DI

Management

-   Step 1: Treat any underlying cause (vomiting, hyperglycemia,
    medications)
-   Step 2: Determine volume status: If severely volume deplete (i.e.
    hypotensive) the patient will need lactated ringers to restore
    volume first and then D5W to restore free water
-   Step 3: Estimate free water deficit (FWD) and replete as below:
    -   Online calculators available (MDCalc)
        : FWD = TBW x \[(serum Na/140) - 1\]
-   Step 4: determine if chronic or acute

Acute Hypernatremia

-   Correction for severe
    hypernatremia (\<48 in duration, Na >158), Na <sup>+</sup> \<145
    within 24h
-   Requires
    ICU level care:
    Trend
    Na <sup>+</sup>
    q 2-3 hrs (plus glucose, if using D5W)
    -   Once
        Na <sup>+</sup>
        \<145, can space to q6-8hrs
-   Start D5W at 3-6 cc/kg/hr ( <sup>1/</sup> <sub>2</sub> NS if pt is
    severely hyperglycemic), titrate to desired correction rate

Chronic Hypernatremia

-   Correction
    (>48h, most common scenario), aim for slow correction of
    10 mEq/L per day
-   Use the free water deficit to guide your plan and total free water
    needs
-   Trend Na q8-12hrs until stable at desired correction rate, then can
    space to q12-24h
-   Start D5W and give based on free water deficit; for starting rate
    and length you can also use “Stone’s formula”: 2 x body weight in kg
    = rate \[mL/hr\], and 2 x change in
    Na <sup>+</sup>
    desired = length \[hrs\] (e.g. if you want to drop
    Na <sup>+</sup>
    by 6 then run for 12 hrs)
-   If severely hyperglycemic: Use 1/2NS at 1.35 mL/hr x patient’s
    weight in kg if pt
-   If mild and pt neurologically intact, may be done with oral or
    enteral (if feeding tube) water

Additional Information

-   Pts w/
    suspected DI: **Consult Nephrology** (may require desmopressin or
    may receive desmopressin once stabilized to differentiate between
    central and nephrogenic DI)
-   Consider Urine volume an ongoing loss of free water, and add it to
    the D5W replacement
-   Pts with hypokalemia: giving K decreases total amount of free water
    you are giving the pt
