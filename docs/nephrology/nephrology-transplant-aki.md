# Transplant AKI

Transplant

AKI

Background

-   Allograft
    dysfunction
    -   Increase in serum **Cr <u>\></u> 25 %** from baseline in 1-3
        months
    -   Failure of creatine to decrease post-transplant
    -   Proteinuria >1g/day
-   How
    to think of transplant AKI?  Categorize dysfunction relative to
    transplant date
    -   Don’t forget about: Pre-, intra- and post- renal
-   Dysfunction
    by time course:
    -   \< 1-week
        post-transplant: \[usually managed within transplant
        hospitalization\]
        -   Often delayed graft function, can require dialysis in week 1
            until graft function
        -   Vascular thrombosis of graft vessels, ATN (common in
            deceased donors)
    -   **\> 1-week** post-transplant (
        HIGH YIELD)
        -   Pyelonephritis/complicated UTI: Fever, abdominal pain, graft
            tenderness
        -   Medication changes: hold new medications if possible
            -   Common offenders: NSAIDs, ACE, diuretics, azole
                antifungals
            -   Medication non-compliance: Tacro and cyclosporine
                (rejection)
        -   Tacrolimus (FK) or cyclosporine (CsA) level:
            supra-therapeutic CNI causes arteriolar constriction and
            decreased GFR
            -   FK levels increase with n/v, diarrhea. FK toxicity also
                causes n/v, diarrhea (chicken vs egg argument)
            -   FK or CsA should be dosed at 6 AM and 6 PM. FK levels
                must be drawn at 5 am (12-hour trough level) to be
                reliable for dosing adjustments
        -   Hypovolemia: fluids
        -   Proteinuria: Transplant patients with 1 g/day proteinuria
            usually get biopsies
            -   Pts are commonly admitted for proteinuria found during
                chronic monitoring

Evaluation

-   Check
    **Cr nadir** post-transplant
-   Obtain donor characteristics (CMV status, PRA, % HLA antibodies
    present)
-   Urinalysis
    , Protein/Cr spot ratio
-   Always
    schedule Tacro and cyclosporine level lab draws
-   Check
    prev. labs for **donor-specific antibodies** (DSAs)
-   BK & CMV PCR: consider only if unclear source of AKI and no recent
    titers
    -   Avoid
        Ig assays, if evaluating for disease PCRs are test of choice

    ? Are you answering a question?
    -   \< 1 week:
        If acute graft dysfunction, look for thrombosis or urine/ureter
        leak
    -   \> 1 week
        :
        -   Cr does not respond to 48 hours of current management
        -   Lack of clear, reversible causes
        -   Hydronephrosis (can occur after stent removal 4-6 wks after
            transplant or due to perinephric fluid collection)
        -   Arterial stenosis (
            ↑
            velocities in renal artery, tardus parvus waveforms)
        -   Perinephric abscess with recurrent UTI/pyelonephritis
        -   Urinoma (usually first 2-3 weeks), hematoma (after a biopsy)
    -   Unique findings:
        -   Resistive indices
            : reflect central renal vascular compliance
        -   High indices in transplant patients signify parenchymal
            problem (rejection, infection, ATN)
-   Still
    Stumped?
    -   Viral infections: BK, CMV: check PCRs
    -   Adenovirus associated with hemorrhagic cystitis, hepatitis, and
        nephritis in transplant patients. Check PCRs (Nasopharynx,
        blood, GI pathogen panel) positivity may suggest
    -   Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD): lymphoid
        proliferations in transplants due to immunosuppression
        -   Serious and potentially fatal; Majority occur in the
            presence of EBV
    -   Biopsy: if renal u/s unremarkable likely warrant biopsy to guide
        therapy
        -   ATN vs rejection vs Adenovirus vs recurrent disease (FSGS,
            lupus, etc.)
-   Post
    Biopsy Care:
    -
    -   Watch for bleeding and HTN
        -   Blood can get into collecting system, then the capsule, and
            into the perinephric space
        -   Page Kidney aka Pressure Tamponade: blood in the capsule
            compresses renal vessels
        -   RAAS surge --> **rapid, severe HTN** (STAT page the renal
            fellow)
