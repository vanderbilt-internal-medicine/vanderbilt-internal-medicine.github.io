# Hyperphosphatemia

Hyperphosphatemia – Peter Thorne, Amanda Morrison

Background

-   Phosphate (
    PO <sub>4</sub> <sup>-3</sup>
    ) >4.5mg/dL
-   Etiologies:
    -   Cellular lysis (TLS, Rhabdomyolysis)
    -   Increased intake/absorption or iatrogenic hyperphosphatemia
        (Over repletion, Vitamin D toxicity, use of Fleet’s enemas,
        etc.)
    -   Decreased phosphate clearance (Acute or chronic renal disease,
        hypoparathyroidism, pseudohypoparathyroidism)
    -   Acute extracellular shifts of phosphate (DKA, severe Lactic
        acidosis)

Presentation

-   Symptoms are usually secondary to coexistent hypocalcemia
    (psychosis, seizure, perioral paresthesia’s, muscle weakness)
-   Can cause Acute phosphate nephropathy with phosphate containing
    laxatives
-   Calciphylaxis if concurrent hypercalcemia (high Ca <sup>+2</sup> x
    PO <sub>4</sub> <sup>-3</sup>
    product)

Evaluation

-   Labs: BMP (calcium, creatinine), Vit D, PTH, PTHrP, lactate

Management

Acute

-   If renal function normal, can often treat with IVF (promote
    PO <sub>4</sub> <sup>-3</sup>
    excretion)
-   Consider need for calcium supplementation (see hypocalcemia section)
-   If renal function impaired and severe hypocalcemia present =
    consider hemodialysis

Chronic

-   Usually secondary to chronic renal failure, goal
    PO <sub>4</sub> <sup>-3</sup>
    3.5-5.5 in CKD patients
-   Renal diet (low
    PO <sub>4</sub> <sup>-3</sup>
    )
-   PO <sub>4</sub> <sup>-3</sup>
    binders: Ca <sup>+2</sup> containing (calcium carbonate and calcium
    acetate) and non Ca <sup>+2</sup> containing (sevelamer, lanthanum,
    and iron based such as ferric citrate)
    -   -   Sevelamer is significantly more expensive than calcium
            containing binders
            -   Given 3 times daily with meals, started at 800mg (Can be
                ↑
                to 1,600mg TID)
            -   Should not be given if pt is not eating
        -   Calcium acetate: started at 1334mg TID with meals
-   Limit dose changes to chronic binders upon discharge
-   Need to avoid calcium containing binders in patients with
    calciphylaxis
