Approach to Urinalysis – Laura Binari, Patrick Steadman

Background

-   3
    components
    : Gross Evaluation, Dipstick Analysis, Microscopic Exam
-   Indications: dysuria, gross hematuria, fever, encephalopathy, AKI,
    volume overload
-   Technique: collect in clear, dry container; Pts instructed to clean
    external genitalia, provide midstream specimen; If Foley, obtain
    sample from catheter, not the urine bag
-   Spinning
    Urine
    -   -   At VUMC, take sample to lab on 4 <sup>th</sup> floor to
            centrifuge the sample at 1500 rpm for 5 minutes, remove
            supernatant and then resuspend sediment, place drops of
            urine on the slide (there are slides with several discs),
            examine with microscope
        -   At the VA, there is a microscopy room where you can spin
            urine as well- the renal fellow should be happy to help\]
            Ideally, the specimen should be a fresh catch (\<2-4 hours
            old); Beware: casts like to migrate to the edges of the
            coverslip!

Gross Evaluation

-   Turbid: DDx Is infection, precipitated crystals, chyluria
-   Color: Red Urine (broad DDx, see Hematuria section, includes certain
    meds such as rifampin/phenytoin), White (polyuria, phosphate
    crystals), Green (methylene blue), Pink (uric acid crystals,
    post-propofol infusion), Black (hemoglobinuria/myoglobinuria)

Dipstick Analysis

-   Quality of sample: should have zero squamous epithelial cells
-   Specific gravity
    : normal = 1.010
    -   -   Surrogate for urine osmolality & hydration status: can have
            falsely high specific gravity if large particles (contrast,
            glucose) present
        -   Trick: Last 2 digits of S.G. x 30 = Uosm. For example; S.G.
            is 1.013; 13 x 30 = 390 mOsm/L
-   Urinary pH
    : normal pH is 5.5-6.5
    -   -   Alkaline pH: bicarb suppl., vegan diet, urease producing
            organisms (staghorn calculi)
        -   Acidic pH: uric acid stones, appropriate response to
            acidemia
-   Proteinuria
    : dipstick detects albumin ONLY (not paraproteins)
    -   -   Mild albuminuria (30-300 mg/day) not detected by standard
            dipsticks
        -   F/u with spot protein to Cr ratio or 24 hr urine collection
            (nephrotic range >3.5 g/day); consider UPEP/SPEP based on
            clinical presentation.
        -   Transient: due to volume depletion, CHF, fever, postural,
            exercise-induced
        -   Ddx: primary glomerular dx, secondary glomerular dx (DM,
            amyloid, infxn, sickle cell, etc.) vs tubular vs overflow
            (multiple myeloma)
-   Heme
    (see hematuria section): False(+) if semen, false(-) w/ ascorbic
    acid
-   WBC
    :
    -   -   False(+) 2/2 contamination with squamous cells. If bacteria
            -> consider UTI/pyelo w/hematuria -> inflammation; May have
            sterile pyuria
        -   Ddx includes chlamydia, ureaplasma, TB, malignancy, viral
            infxn, kidney stones, GN, urethritis, steroid,
            cyclophosphamide use
-   Ketones
    : detects acetic acid (not beta-hydroxybutyrate)
    -   -   Never normal in urine; only detects acetic acid
        -   Ddx: DKA, starvation ketoacidosis, pregnancy, keto diet
-   Glucose
    : max threshold at proximal tubule exceeded (\~serum glucose 180
    mg/dL)
    -   -   DM, Cushing’s, liver/pancreatic dx, SGLT2i use; or a primary
            defect of proximal reabsorption (w/phosphaturia, uricosuria,
            amino aciduria think Fanconi syndrome)
-   Leukocyte
    **esterase** : enzyme released by lysed neutrophils, macrophages
    -   -   Associated with pyuria and infections; false(-) from
            hematuria or glucosuria
-   Nitrites
    : reduction of urinary nitrates by nitrate reductase
    -   -   Certain bacteria (e.g. Enterobacteriaceae) express, others
            (e.g. Enterococci) do not
        -   Specific but not sensitive for UTI
-   Bilirubin
    : conjugated = water soluble (passes through glomerulus), unlike
    unconjugated
    -   -   Liver dysfunction and biliary obstruction
-   Urobilinogen
    : end product of conjugated bilirubin, normally \~1.0mg/dL is normal
    -   -   Can be elevated due to hepatocellular dx or hemolysis

Microscopic Examination of the Urine Sediment

-   Purpose
    : confirm/quantify dipstick findings + additional information in
    form of cells, casts, or crystals; Casts are cylindrical structures
    formed in tubule lumen
-   Cells
    :
    -   -   Dysmorphic RBCs (sign of GN), squamous epithelial cells
            (contamination), tubular cells (abnormal, indicates renal
            dx), neutrophils (UTI, AIN, TB, sterile pyuria), eosinophils
            (think AIN, not sensitive thus cannot exclude diagnosis)
-   Casts
    :
    -   -   Hyaline (pyelo; CKD, normal subjects), RBC (GN), WBC (GN,
            pyelo, interstitial dx, inflammation), epithelial - renal
            tubular cells (ATN, interstitial nephritis, nephritic sx,
            heavy metal ingestion), granular or waxy (presence of kidney
            disease, but nonspecific), muddy brown casts (ATN); fatty
            (nephrotic syndrome)
-   Crystals
    :
    -   -   Ca++ oxalate (envelope/dumbbell shape), uric acid
            (rhombic/rosette shaped, classically formed in acidic
            urine), cystine (hexagonal, found in cystinuria), Mg ++
            ammonium phosphate (aka struvite stones, from increased
            ammonia production, in setting of urease producing bacteria
            such as Proteus or Klebsiella UTIs)
        -   Calcium oxalate crystals + AKI, consider ethylene glycol
            intoxication
        -   Uric Acid crystals + AKI, consider tumor lysis syndrome
