Falls

Background

-   Screen annually: Ask if elderly pts had falls in the past year
    -   History of fall is a strong risk factor for future falls
    -   Recommended History Screening Tool:  CDC STEADI Algorithm
-   Physical Exam Screening Tools:
    -   If potentially unstable injuries (new spine fracture or lower
        extremity fracture): push ortho to clear the patient for
        mobility
    -   If no potentially unstable injuries, attempt to get the patient
        out of bed
        -   If lying down, have them lift each leg off the bed
        -   If they can do this, ask them to sit up on side of bed
        -   If they can do this, ask them to stand
        -   If they can do this without assistance, then observe them
            walk
    -   The Timed “up and Go” Test (TUG) tool for fall risk
        -   Have the patient rise from sitting in a chair, walk 10 feet
            forward, turn around, walk back to chair, and sit down
        -   Patients who require > 10 seconds are at increased risk for
            falls
-   Med Rec:
    -   Antipsychotics, antidepressants, anticholinergics, anxiolytics,
        sedatives/hypnotics, anti-hypertensives, antiarrhythmics,
        steroids, statins all can increase risk of falls

Management

-   Rule out other causes: Cardiac, Neurologic, Infectious
-   Check Vitamin D levels (goal > 30)
    -   Supplement (800-1000 IU daily) if at increased fall risk
-   Assess visual acuity (e.g. expedite cataract surgery)
-   Hearing assessment (audiology screen)
-   Consult Inpatient PT/OT
-   Recommend non-skid shoes with a backing (sneaker)
-   Home health PT or OT for home safety evaluation at discharge
    -   Modify extrinsic risk factors for falls: removal of fall
        hazards, placement of hand rails
-   Referral to Exercise programs: At VUMC = Dayani Center “Ambulatory
    Referral to Medical Fitness” outpatient order
