# Agitation Management 

Jonathan Constant, Jonathan Smith

## Background

- Agitation in the hospital result from discomfort, illness,
    medication effects or frustrations the patient is unable to
    meaningfully communicate

## Presentation

- Impulsive aggression: spontaneous, explosive, reactive/reflexive,
    not pre-meditated

    - Delirium, psychosis, cognitive deficits, withdrawal/intoxication,
        pain, post-ictal

- Instrumental aggression: pre-meditated, controlled, purposeful
    behaviors

    - Personality disorders, secondary gain, delusional thought

- Differential diagnosis for aggression:

    - Psychoses: mania, depression, schizophrenia, delusional disorder

    - Personality disorder: antisocial, borderline, paranoid, narcissistic

    - Substance use disorder: alcohol, PCP, stimulants, cocaine,
        synthetics

    - Delirium, dementia

    - Frontal lobe syndromes (TBI, CVA, neoplasm, neurodegenerative
        process)

    - Behavior/Developmental: Intermittent explosive, intellectual
        disability

## Evaluation

- Examine (when calm) for source of pain, signs of infection,
    discomfort (ex: urinary retention or constipation), toxidromes

- Neurological exam for focal deficits, ataxia, nystagmus, tremor,
    rigidity, aphasias

- Review medication list and perform med reconciliation of home meds

- UDS + review of CSMD for evaluation of intoxication/withdrawal

- CBC, CMP, UA

- CT head + EEG if focal neurologic deficits

## Management

- Environment

    - Periodic room searches; search personal belongings, VUPD presence if
        warranted

    - Virtual or 1:1 sitter placement,

    - Delirium precautions (see delirium section)

    - Disposable trays and utensils (minimize potential weapons in the
        room)

- De-escalation: Always first line, although impractical if pt is
    unable to communicate effectively, is explosive or already engaging
    in violent/potentially harmful behavior

    - Nonverbal:

        - Maintain safe distance, avoid sudden movements, don't touch the
            pt

        - Maintain neutral posture, neutral, sincere eye contact, same
            height

    - Verbal:

        - Speak in calm, clear tone, avoid confrontation, and offer to
            solve problem if possible

        - Do not insist on having the last word

- Tactics

    - Redirection: Acknowledge pt's frustrations; shift focus on how to
        solve the problem

    - Aligning goals: Emphasize common ground and big picture; make small
        concessions

- Restraints

    - Should be used only when necessary to protect patient or others from
        harm

        - Mechanically restrained patients cannot be left unmonitored

    - De-escalate (4 point to 2 point, etc) and remove restraints as soon
        as possible

    - Documentation of restraint:

        - Face-to-face assessment has to be completed within an hour of
            violent restraint

        - “Restraint Charting” tab – typically in rarely used tab drop
            down

    - Mechanical Restraints:

        - Soft restraints – most commonly used

        - Hard restraints – reserved for severe behavioral health (only 2
            sets in house)

        - Mittens

        - Posey Vest – prevents exiting bed, allows limbs to be free

        - Posey Bed – wandering patient (TBI, severe dementia)

    - VUMC Orders: “restraint” --\> order set

        - Non-violent non-self-destructive (order lasts up to 48 hrs)

            - Most pts needing restraint: non-psychiatric, delirium,
                dementia, intubation

        - Restraint violent self- destructive adult

            - Order lasts up to 24hr with assessment every 4 hours

            - Mainly severe psychiatric symptoms

# Pharmacological Management for Agitation

As discussed above, behavioral interventions are first line for
agitation management in the hospital. Pharmacologic treatment should
only be used when needed for patient and/or staff safety when
non-pharmacologic interventions are unsuccessful or impractical

## Acute Agitation

- Antipsychotics

    - Widely effective for acute agitation, especially in delirium and
        psychotic disorders

    - Monitor EKG if repeated dosing or if used with other QT prolonging
        agents

    - Moderate agitation options:

        - Olanzapine 2.5 - 5mg po q6h prn. Orally disintegrating tab (ODT)
            available

        - Quetiapine 12.5 - 25mg q6h po prn for patients at higher risk of
            extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS)

    - Severe agitation

        - Haldol 0.5 - 1mg IV/IM q6h prn for older/frail individuals

        - Haldol 2-3mg IV/IM q6h prn for other patients

        - Titrate up to 5 mg and can increase frequency as warranted

        - When using IV Haldol obtain daily EKG, Mg and K levels

        - Stop IV Haldol if QTc \> 500 msec

- Benzodiazepines

    - Lacks EPS that can occur with antipsychotics but can worsen delirium
        & disinhibit patients with neurocognitive-related agitation

    - Can use alone or in addition to antipsychotic agent

    - Preferred for agitation related to intoxication/withdrawal of
        sedatives

        - Lorazepam preferentially used due to PO, IV and IM availability

        - Lorazepam 2mg PO/IM/IV q6h prn typical starting dose (1mg if
            older/frail)

            - Can increase frequency if warranted. Monitor for respiratory
                suppression

- If severe agitation not responsive to above, may require sedation
    with infusion:

    - Dexmedetomidine, Propofol or Midazolam

## Maintenance medications:

- Antipsychotics

    - Reserve antipsychotics for severe aggression that pose significant
        risk and aim to wean as soon as safely possible

    - Adverse effects: metabolic, EPS, increased mortality in dementia

    - Most commonly used: Olanzapine, Quetiapine, Risperidone

- Antiepileptic agents

- May be effective in reduction of impulsive aggression

- Most commonly used: Depakote

    - Levetiracetam could worsen aggression/agitation

- Beta Blockers and Alpha Agonists

    - Noradrenergic over-activity implicated in aggression expression

    - Commonly Used: Propranolol, Clonidine, Guanfacine

- Serotonergic agents: SSRI/SNRI/buspirone

    - Useful if co-occurring depression/anxiety disorders

    - Peak onset of action takes weeks
