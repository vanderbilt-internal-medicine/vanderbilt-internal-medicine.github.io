# Medical Hold

Medical Hold – Chelsea Sprick, Barrington Hwang

Background

-   6404: applies when there is a need for psychiatric hospitalization
    -   Can only be completed by a licensed physician
        -   Psychiatry residents can write these due to their special
            training licenses
-   No AMA Medical Hold: useful when a pt does not have capacity to
    leave the hospital against medical advice and needs to remain in the
    hospital
    -   Can be ordered by any physician
-   6401 vs. 6404: Tennessee Title 33, Chapter 6, Part 4 is the legal
    code
    -   "6401": the form needed for emergency detention, examination and
        admissio
        -   One person completes this
-   "6404": the certificates for emergency involuntary admission
    -   The first 6404 is needed to transport a patient to a psychiatric
        facility and the second 6404 is needed for an involuntary
        admission
    -   Pt must have mental illness or serious emotional disturbance,
        excluding intellectual/developmental disabilities and pose an
        immediate substantial likelihood of serious harm because of
        this, as evidenced by current/past SI/HI/SIB or deterioration at
        point of inability to care for self at significant risk to self
        or others
    -   Treatment must be necessary for symptom reduction and lack of
        treatment would lead to deterioration, with no less drastic
        alternative to inpatient hospitalization.
    -   Two different qualified persons must each complete a form

Additional Information

-   VUH-specific procedures
    -   A physical copy of (at least) the first 6404 is required to
        accompany the patient when they are transported to a psychiatric
        facility after medical discharge
    -   Once completed, 6404s should be given to the medical
        receptionist on the unit for scanning into the medical record
        and for safe-keeping
-   Consider whether a pt has a conservator or activated healthcare POA
-   If the conservator/POA is willing and able to complete the consent
    for admission, the pt can be admitted voluntarily
    -   The first 6404 would still be necessary for transportation to a
        psychiatric facility
-   Unless the pt has a mental health-related condition or qualifies
    under the criteria above, pt is NOT committable under the
    involuntary admission
-   Just because someone wants to leave to use substances does not in
    itself mean they are committable, even if it does not seem like a
    good decision
-   While this may seem obvious, a 6404 or No AMA/Medical Hold takes
    away the personal liberties of an individual and this is a serious
    decision
