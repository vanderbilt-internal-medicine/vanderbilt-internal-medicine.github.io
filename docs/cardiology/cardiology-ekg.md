# Approach to the ECG

Melis Sahinoz

---

Method = mastery, approach each EKG the same.

## Rate

- Regular rhythms = “Rule of 300” = 300 ÷ (large boxes between QRS
    complexes)
- 1 box = 300 bpm, 2 boxes = 150 bpm, 3 boxes = 100 bpm, 4 boxes = 75 bpm, 5 boxes = 60 bpm, 6 boxes = 50 bpm 
- Irregular rhythms or severe bradycardia = (total number of QRS
    complexes on ECG) x 6

## Rhythm

- Determine regular vs irregular: calipers or march out QRS complexes
    on paper
- Criteria for Sinus rhythm: P before every QRS; Upright P in Lead I,
    II; Negative in aVr

## Axis

- Normal: - 30<sup>o</sup> to + 90<sup>o</sup>
- Quick method: Leads I and II
- Normal Axis: Upright in I and II
- Left Axis Deviation: Upright in I, down in II
    - Causes: LVH, LBBB, Left anterior fascicular block, prior
        inferior MI
- Right Axis Deviation: Down in I, up in II
    - Causes: RVH, RBBB, Left posterior fascicular block, prior
        lateral MI, PE

## Intervals

- PR Interval: normal 120 – 200 ms
    - If < 120 ms, consider pre-excitation with accessory pathway (i.e.
        WPW)
    - If > 200 ms, first degree AV block
- QRS Complex: 60 – 100 ms (normal)
    - If 100-120 ms: Incomplete BBB or non-specific intraventricular
        conduction delay (IVCD)
    - If > 120ms: complete BBB, ventricular tachycardia, hyperkalemia
- QT interval: Normal duration < 450ms in men and < 460ms in women
    - QT is inversely proportional to HR (QT interval shortens at faster
        HRs)
    - Quick estimate: normal QT is less than half the preceding RR
        interval
    - QTc estimates the QT interval at a HR of 60 bpm (to allow for
        comparison across HRs)
    - A couple formulas exist to calculate QTc:
        - QTcB= most commonly used due to simplicity, most accurate HR of
            60
        - QTcF= more accurate when HR is outside the range of 60-100
    - Clinically significant when generally QTc > 500 ms
    - Causes of Prolonged QTc: hereditary, medication-induced
        (anti-emetics, ABX, psychiatric meds), hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia,
        hypocalcemia, ischemia

## Morphology

- P wave: P waves in limb leads should be ≤2.5 small box high and ≤2.5
    small box wide
    - Right Atrial Enlargement: Peaked P Wave in Lead II that measures >2.5 mm
    - Left Atrial Enlargement
        - Lead II: Bifid P Wave (two humps) with total duration > 110 ms
        - Lead V1: Biphasic P wave, terminal deflection > 1mm wide and deep
    - If ≥ 3 different P wave morphologies in same lead: wandering atrial
        pacemaker (HR < 100) or multifocal atrial tachycardia (HR > 100)
- QRS complex
    - Voltage
        - Low voltage: QRS amplitude < 5mm in limb leads or < 10mm in
            precordial
            - Causes: pericardial effusion, infiltrative cardiomyopathy,
                obesity
        - Right Ventricular Hypertrophy: Tall R Waves in V1 (> 7mm) and
            right axis deviation
        - Left Ventricular Hypertrophy: multiple criteria exist
            - Sokolow-Lyon criteria is a common example: S in V1 + R in V5
                or V6 >35mm, R in aVL ≥ 1.1 mV
- Conduction delays
    - RBBB: Wide QRS and RSR’ in V1 or V2; deep broad S In lateral
        leads
    - LBBB: Wide QRS, large S in V1, broad monophasic R wave in
        lateral leads (I, aVL, V6)
- R wave progression
    - R wave normally gets progressively larger from V1 to V6
    - If the transition does not occur by V4, this is called "poor R
        wave progression". This is seen in chronic lung disease, LVH,
        left anterior fascicular block, and anterior MI.
- Q-wave: Small Q waves are normal in most leads
    - Never normal in V1-V3
    - Pathologic Q waves: > 1 box wide and 2 boxes deep or > 25% height
        of R wave
- ST Segment
    - ST Elevation: STEMI, LBBB (ST elevation in leads with deep S waves),
        LVH, ventricular paced rhythm, pericarditis (associated with PR
        depression), coronary vasospasm, Brugada syndrome
    - ST Depression: ischemia, reciprocal change in STEMI, posterior
        myocardial infarction (V1-V3), digoxin, hypokalemia
    - See ACS section for STEMI criteria, Wellens Syndrome
- T wave
    - Normal T waves are upright in all leads except aVR and V1
    - Inverted T Waves
        - Acute ischemia (if present in contiguous leads), LBBB (in
            lateral leads), RBBB (V1-V3), LVH (‘strain’ pattern similar to
            LBBB), RVH (RV ‘strain’ in V1-V3 or inferior leads), PE (right
            heart strain or part of S1,Q3,T3), intracranial pathology
    - Peaked T Waves
        - Hyperkalemia vs ‘hyperacute’ T waves that precede ST elevation
            and Q waves in STEMI
