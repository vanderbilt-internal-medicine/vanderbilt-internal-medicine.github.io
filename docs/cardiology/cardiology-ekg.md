Rate:

-   Regular rhythms, “Rule of 300” = 300
    ÷
    (large boxes between QRS complexes)
    -   300, 150, 100, 75, 60, 50
-   Irregular rhythms or severe bradycardia = (total number of QRS
    complexes on ECG) x 6

Rhythm:

-   Determine regular vs irregular: calipers or march out QRS complexes
    on paper
-   Criteria for Sinus rhythm: P before every QRS; Upright P in Lead I,
    II; Negative in aVr

Axis:

-   Normal: - 30 <sup>o</sup> to + 90 <sup>o</sup>
-   Quick method: Leads I and II
    -   Normal Axis: Upright in I and II
    -   Left Axis Deviation: Upright in I, down in II
        -   Causes: LVH, LBBB, Left anterior fascicular block, prior
            inferior MI
    -   Right Axis Deviation: Down in I, up in II
        -   Causes: RVH,
            RBBB, Left posterior fascicular block, prior lateral MI

Intervals:

-   PR Interval: normal 120 – 200 ms
    -   If \< 120 ms, consider pre-excitation with accessory pathway
        (i.e. WPW)
    -   If > 200 ms, first degree AV block
-   QRS Complex: normal duration 60 – 100 ms
    -   100-120 ms: Incomplete BBB or non-specific intraventricular
        conduction delay (IVCD)
    -   \> 120ms: complete BBB, ventricular tachycardia, hyperkalemia
-   QT interval: Normal duration \< 450ms in men and \< 460ms in women
    -   QT is inversely proportional to HR (QT interval shortens at
        faster HRs)
    -   Clinically significant when generally QTc > 500 ms
    -   Quick estimate: normal QT is less than half the preceding RR
        interval
    -   QTc is corrected to estimate QT interval at HR of 60 bpm
    -   Causes of Prolonged QTc: hereditary, medication-induced
        (anti-emetics, ABX, psychiatric meds), hypokalemia,
        hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, ischemia

Morphology:

-   P Wave
    -   If
        ≥
        3 different P wave morphologies in same lead: wandering atrial
        pacemaker (HR \< 100) or multifocal atrial tachycardia
        (HR > 100)
    -   Right Atrial Enlargement
        -   Peaked P Wave (P Pulmonale) in Lead II that measures >2.5 mm
    -   Left Atrial Enlargement
        -   Lead II: Bifid P Wave (two humps) with total duration > 110
            ms
    -   Lead V1
        : Biphasic P wave, terminal deflection > 1mm wide and deep'
-   Q Waves
    -   Small Q waves are normal in most leads (never normal in V1-V3)
    -   Pathologic Q Waves: > 1 box wide and 2 boxes deep or > 25%
        height of R wave
-   QRS Complex
    -   Voltage:
        -   Low Voltage: QRS amplitude \< 5mm in limb leads or \< 10mm
            in precordial
            -   Causes: pericardial effusion, infiltrative
                cardiomyopathy, obesity
        -   Right Ventricular Hypertrophy: Tall R Waves in V1 (> 7mm)
            and Right axis deviation
        -   Left Ventricular Hypertrophy: multiple criteria exis
            -   Sokolow-Lyon is most common: S wave in V1 + R Wave in V5
                or V6 > 35 mm
            -   ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
                Can be accompanied by ST segment depression and T
                wa
                ve inversion in lateral leads (left ventricular strain
                pattern)
-   Conduction delays
    -   RBBB: Wide QRS and RSR’ in V1 or V2
    -   ​​​​​​​
        LBBB: Wide QRS, large S in V1, broad monophasic R wave in
        lateral leads (I, aVL, V6)
-   ST Segment Changes
    -   ST Elevation:  STEMI, LBBB (ST elevation in leads with deep S
        waves), LVH, Ventricular paced rhythm, Pericarditis (associated
        with PR depression), coronary vasospasm, Brugada syndrome
        -   ST Depression: ischemia, reciprocal change in STEMI,
            posterior myocardial infarction (V1-V3), digoxin,
            hypokalemia
        -   Wellens Syndrome:
        -   Biphasic T waves or deeply inverted T waves in leads V2-3 in
            pts with angina
        -   Highly specific of critical stenosis of LAD
        -   Require coronary angiogram; Increased risk of MI/cardiac
            arrest with stress test
        -   Type A: Biphasic T waves with initial positivity and
            terminal negativity in V2-V3
        -   Type B: Deeply and symmetrically inverted T waves in V2-V3
-   T Wave
    -   Normal T waves are upright in all leads except aVR and V1
        -   Inverted T Waves
        -   DDX: acute ischemia (if present in contiguous leads), LBBB
            (in lateral leads I, aVL, V5-6), RBBB (V1-V3), LVH (‘strain’
            pattern similar to LBBB), RVH (RV ‘strain’ in V1-V3 or
            inferior leads), Pulmonary Embolism (right heart strain or
            part of S1,Q3,T3)
            -   -   Peaked T Waves
        -   DDX: hyperkalemia vs ‘hyperacute’ T waves that precede ST
            elevation and Q waves in STEMI
