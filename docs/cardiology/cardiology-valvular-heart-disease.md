# Valvular Heart Disease

Valvular Heart Disease – Benjamin Palmer

Background

-   Aortic Stenosis: Degenerative calcification of the aortic cusps,
    usually due to congenital disease (bicuspid), chronic deterioration,
    or previous rheumatic inflammation
-   Aortic Insufficiency: Primary
    valve disease (rheumatic disease, bicuspid aortic valve, infective
    endocarditis, syphilis) or primary aortic root disease (medial
    degeneration, aortic dissection, Marfan’s syndrome, bicuspid aortic
    valve, syphilis, non-syndromic familial)
-   Mitral Regurgitation:
    -   Acute: endocarditis, papillary muscle rupture post-MI, trauma,
        chordal rupture/leaflet flail in the setting of mitral valve
        prolapse
    -   Chronic: myxomatous degeneration, rheumatic fever, healed
        endocarditis, mitral annular calcification, HOCM with systolic
        anterior motion, dilated cardiomyopathy
    -   Secondary (aka “functional”): 2/2 LV dilation/dysfunction w/
        structurally normal MV
-   Mitral Stenosis: Rheumatic fever is the leading cause of mitral
    stenosis worldwide
    -   Calcific MS is more common in high income countries

Aortic stenosis

Presentation

-   Angina, syncope, exertional dyspnea, heart failure
-   70 – 80 y/o symptoms; if bicuspid aortic valve expect 10-20 yrs
    earlier
-   Physical exam:
    Systolic crescendo-decrescendo murmur that radiates towards the
    carotids
    -   Late peaking murmur, faint or absent S2, delayed carotid
        upstroke (suggest severe AS)

Management

-   Definitive treatment is valve replacement, with the most common
    indication being symptomatic, severe aortic stenosis
    -   Consult
        cardiac surgery for determination of SAVR vs TAVR (often a
        multidisciplinary decision between cardiac surgery and TAVR
        team)
    -   In
        general
        , high risk surgical patients benefit most from TAVR
-   VUMC:  If the pt is determined to be intermediate to high operative
    risk by Cardiac Surgery, they will often recommend contacting the
    TAVR team for evaluation
-   Avoid rapid hemodynamic shifts and aggressive changes in preload or
    afterload
-   Aim for normotension: avoid preferential vasodilators such as
    hydralazine or nitroglycerin
    -   significant vasodilation may
        ↓
        coronary filling pressures
        
        myocardial ischemia
-   Monitoring:
    -   Severe AS: TTE q 6-12 months; Moderate AS: TTE q 1-2 years; Mild
        AS: TTE q 3-5 years

Aortic Regurgitation

Presentation

-   Acute ****
    AR: The LV cannot respond to increased volume to maintain stroke
    volume, and thus patient will present with pulmonary edema and
    cardiogenic shock
-   Chronic AR
    : More indolent presentation, often patient will develop symptoms of
    heart failure including DoE, followed by orthopnea, PND
-   Physical exam: “Water-hammer” pulses, Quincke’s pulses, wide pulse
    pressure, laterally displaced PMI, high pitched “blowing”
    decrescendo murmur best heard at third intercostal space at left
    sternal border, Austin Flint murmur, S3 ​​​​​​​

Management

-   Acute
    severe AR should be treated with prompt surgical repair
-   Vasodilators
    such as nitroprusside and diuretics can be used to stabilize patient
-   Chronic
    severe AR should undergo replacement if:
    -   Class I indications: Symptomatic, LVEF \< 50%, or are undergoing
        other cardiac surgery
    -   If LVEF > or equal 50%, patients should be considered for
        surgery if LVESD > 50 mm (class IIa) or LVEDD > 65 mm (class
        IIb)
    -   Any patient with progressive AR, even if they do not meet
        criteria for severe AR, should consider valve replacement if
        undergoing cardiac surgery for other reasons
    -   Quick mnemonic: 50/50 rule
-   Early
    symptoms of exercise intolerance can be treated with diuretics
-   Systolic
    BP should also be controlled with goal SBP \< 140 in chronic AR
-   Monitor
    over time for development of depressed LVEF and/or LV dilation

Mitral regurgitation

Presentation

-   Isolated
    chronic mild to moderate MR is typically only minimally symptomatic
-   Pts
    w/ severe chronic MR develop progressively worsening dyspnea,
    orthopnea, and PND
-   Palpitations
    may develop in the setting of new atrial fibrillation due to LA
    remodeling/dilation
-   Acute
    severe MR typically presents with flash pulmonary edema
-   Holosystolic
    murmur most prominent at the apex and radiating towards the axilla,
    frequently associated with S3
-   In
    acute
    severe MR, pulmonary congestion is typically present
-   Murmur may be absent due to large regurgitant orifice/low velocity
    regurgitant jet

Management

-   Acute severe MR should be treated with surgery
    -   Utilize diuretic therapy and vasodilators such as nitroprusside
        as means to stabilize patient; Afterload reduction is key to
        promote forward flow
-   Chronic
    severe primary MR, **surgical repair** (favored over valve
    replacement)
    -   Performed if patient develops symptoms (EF > 30% class I, EF \<
        30% class IIb)
    -   Asymptomatic patients if LVEF 30-59% or LVESD > or equal 40 mm
        (class I)
    -   If EF > or equal 60% and LVESD \< 40 mm, or new onset AF or
        PASP > 50, can also consider repair in low-risk patient (class
        IIa). **Quick mnemonic: 60/40**
-   Secondary MR can consider MV repair with persistent class III-IV
    symptoms while on
    guideline
    directed medical therapy
-   If
    HFrEF
    , consider MitraClip after volume optimization (see HF section)

Mitral Stenosis

Presentation

-   Dyspnea and cough typically occur with activities that increase the
    flow and pressure gradient across the valve, such as
    tachy-arrhythmias
-   As the stenosis worsens, symptoms of PND and orthopnea develop
-   Physical
    exam:
    Accentuated S1, prominent P2 if pulmonary hypertension develops,
    opening snap heard at cardiac apex followed by low-pitched rumbling
    diastolic murmur

Management

-   Varies between rheumatic MS and calcific MS; in general,
    intervention of calcific MS is very challenging and high risk
-   Severe
    , symptomatic rheumatic MS: percutaneous mitral balloon
    commissurotomy (PMBC)
    -   ​​​​​​​
        Surgical repair/replacement if pt failed PMBC or undergoing
        other cardiac surgery
-   Intervention for calcific MS is higher risk and should be reserved
    only for severely symptomatic patients (in general, prognosis is
    poor: 5-year survival \<50%)
    -   No role for commissurotomy with calcific MS, surgical valve
        replacement may be considered for severely symptomatic patients
        (technically challenging)
