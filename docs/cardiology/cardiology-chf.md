Congestive Heart Failure - Madeleine Alder

Background

-   HFrEF
    -   Ischemic
        (40%): Obstructive CAD, previous/current myocardial infarction
    -   NICM
        (60%): HTN, idiopathic, myocarditis, genetic/familial, valvular,
        tachycardia/PVC-induced, infiltrative (amyloid, sarcoid,
        hemochromatosis), Takotsubo/stress cardiomyopathy, peripartum
        CM, substance abuse, chemotherapy/toxin-induced, "burned out"
        hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
-   HFpEF
    :
    HTN
    , CAD, obesity, DM, infiltrative, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
-   Causes
    of Heart Failure Exacerbations ( **FAILURES** )
    -   Forgetting
        medications or **taking** drugs that can worsen HF (e.g. BB,
        CCB, NSAIDs, TZDs), chemo (anthracyclines, trastuzumab)
    -   Arrhythmia
        : AF, VT, PVCs; Increased arrhythmia burden on device check?
    -   Ischemia or Infarction or Infection
        ; myocarditis; Acute vascular dysfunction (e.g. endocarditis),
        especially mitral or aortic regurgitation.
    -   Lifestyle choices
        : Dietary indiscretions - high salt, EtOH, excessive fluid
        intake. Obesity.
    -   Upregulation
        (pregnancy and hyperthyroidism)
    -   Renal failure
        : acute, progression of CKD, or insufficient dialysis (Increased
        preload)
    -   Embolus
        (pulmonary) or COPD (leads to increase right-sided afterload)
    -   Stenosis
        (worsening AS, RAS) leading to hypertensive crisis
        
        high left-sided afterload

Presentation

-   Congestion
    : shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion, Orthopnea, PND
-   Nausea
    /poor po intake
-   Confusion
-   Exam
    : Edema (legs, sacrum); Rales, S3, S4, murmur (AS, MR), Elevated
    JVD, + Hepatojugular reflex, Ascites

Evaluation

-   CBC
    , CMP, Magnesium
-   Lactate, Troponin, BNP
-   Pro-BNP if on Entresto)
-   TSH
-   Iron studies
-   EKG
-   CXR, TTE
-   Determine Hemodynamic Profile

Management

-   Telemetry
    , Daily STANDING weights, 2 L fluid restriction, 2g sodium diet,
    Strict I/Os
-   Cold
    and Wet
    à
    may require ionotropic support or transfer to the CCU
-   Warm and Wet
    à
    Diuresis
    -   Diuresis
        : Place on 2.5 x home dose of IV diuretic, dose BID-TID (DOSE
        Trial)
        -   Goal is to be net negative (generally 1-2 L per day, but
            patient dependent)
        -   Check BMP and Mg BID and keep K>4 and Mg>2
        -   Monitor UOP and weights to determine if dosing adequate
        -   Low threshold for substantial increase (double) in loop vs
            transition to drip
        -   Can also augment with sequential nephron blockade
            (thiazides, acetazolamide)

Goal-Directed Medical Therapy

ACE-Inhibitors/ARBs

-   Blocks harmful effects of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system
    activation and attenuates adverse cardiac and vascular remodeling
-   If planning on using Entresto eventually, favor ARB over ACE-i in
    short term
-   Sacubitril-valsartan (Entresto):  Additional benefit of Neprilysin
    inhibition
    -   36-hour washout after stopping ACE-i before starting Entresto to
        avoid angioedema

Aldosterone receptor antagonists

-   Diuretic and blood pressure lowering effects and blocks deleterious
    effects of aldosterone on the heart (including hypertrophy and
    fibrosis)
-   May also reduce hospitalizations in HFpEF
-   Worry about hyperkalemia: avoid if CrCl\<30 or K>5

Beta-blockers

-   Reduces catecholamine stimulation including elevated heart rate,
    increased myocardial energy demands, adverse remodeling due to
    cardiac myocyte hypertrophy and death
-   Mortality benefit shown with carvedilol, metoprolol succinate or
    bisoprolol
-   Avoid if pt is decompensated (cold); “start low and go slow”
-   Can continue during exacerbation if patient compensated, (ie not in
    shock)

Hydralazine/Isosorbide Dinitrate

-   Reduces cardiac afterload and preload and may also enhance nitric
    oxide bioavailability
-   Reduction in mortality for African American patients

SGLT-2 inhibitors

-   Osmotic diuresis and natriuresis, improve myocardial metabolism,
    inhibit sodium-hydrogen exchange in myocardium, reduce cardiac
    fibrosis

Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT)

-   Criteria: HFrEF with LVEF ≤35%, QRS ≥150 ms with left bundle branch
    block (LBBB); NYHA class II to ambulatory class IV HF and wide QRS

Mitra Clip

-   Criteria: mitral regurgitation of 3-4+, on maximally tolerated GDMT,
    an ejection fraction >20%, and a left ventricle end-systolic
    dimension of less than 7 cm

Iron

repletion

-   Criteria: ferritin \<100 µg/L or ferritin 100-299 µg/L AND
    transferrin saturation \<20%.
-   Replete intravenous (IV) iron. IV iron sucrose (500 mg x2 doses 48
    hours apart) or ferric carboxymaltose (maximum dose of 1000 mg per
    week) or iron dextran (1 g x1)

Additional Information:

-   ICD placement (See Below, eg [Cardiac
    Devices](https://medsites.vumc.org/commodorecompendium/cardiac-devices)
    )
-   Starting patients on low dose of multiple agents preferred to max
    dose of single agent
-   D/C summary should have discharge weight, diuretic regimen, and
    renal function
-   Daily weights at home with rescue diuretic plan (pm dose for 3 lbs
    in 1 day, 5 lbs in 3 days)
