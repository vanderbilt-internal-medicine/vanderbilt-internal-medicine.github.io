Autonomics and Orthostatic Hypotension - Ruey Hu

Background

-   Orthostatic Hypotension (OH)
    = SBP
    ↓
    **<u>\></u> 20 mmHg (or DBP**
    ↓
    <u>\></u> 10 mmHg
    ) within 3 min of standing up or head-up tilt to 60% on a tilt table
-   If HR rise is \< 15, it’s probably neurogenic OH (nOH)
-   If HR rise >15 within 3 min of standing, it’s non-neurogenic OH
-   In normal ppl, standing causes minimal changes (SBP
    ↓
    less than 10, DBP rises less than 2.5) and HR rises modestly by
    10-20
-   Etiology: volume depletion (most common), medications, neuropathy,
    neurodegenerative disease (Parkinsonism), pump failure (severe AS,
    arrhythmia)

Evaluation

-   Orthostatic vitals sign measurement:
    -   Lying BP & HR, then wait 5 mins
    -   Sitting BP & HR, then wait 5 mins
    -   Standing BP & HR at 1, 3, and 5 mins
        -   If pt falls before 5 mins is up, get BP & HR before and
            after falling
        -   If supine HTN present, skip the supine step to avoid risk of
            stroke
-   Volume status exam, CBC, BMP, EKG, TSH, B12, MMA, LFTs, SPEP/UPEP
-   Rarely neoplastic panels, supine/standing plasma fractioned
    catecholamine levels and autonomic function testing

Management

-   Neurogenic:
    -   Conservative measures: TED hose, Elevate HOB and Abdominal
        binder
    -   Drink 16oz of fluid 15 min prior to standing
    -   If they have supine HTN, keep HOB 30-45 degrees at all times
-   Outpatients: TED hose and abdominal binder.
    -   Add 2.3-4.6g of salt per day to diet (if no contraindications,
        e.g. CHF)
    -   Do non-gravitationally challenging exercises: stationary bike,
        rower or water activities
    -   Avoid high temperatures (which cause peripheral vasodilation
        )
-   Pharmacologic

Additional Information

-   Ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, methylphenidate, and dextroamphetamine
    are no longer used to treat nOH because of lack of efficacy and
    intolerable CNS effects
-   Autonomic Function Testing: Available
