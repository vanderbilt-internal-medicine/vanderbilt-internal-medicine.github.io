-   Physical
    medicine and rehabilitation (PM&R) physicians focus on restoring
    function and quality of life to those with physical impairments or
    disabilities affecting the brain, spinal cord, nerves, bones,
    joints, ligaments, muscles and tendons
-   Physiatrists
    specialize in determining appropriate rehab options for hospitalized
    patients

<!-- -->

-   Acute Inpatient Rehabilitation (IPR) or Inpatient Rehabilitation
    facility (IRF):
    -   IPR involves a multidisciplinary team of physicians, physical
        therapists, occupational therapists, speech and language
        pathologists
    -   Pts admitted to IPR must be able to tolerate a minimum of 3 hrs
        of rehab per day for 5 days a week
    -   Pts must have medical complexity warranting medical supervision
        by a physician
    -   Physicians are required to evaluate admitted patients at least 3
        times a week
    -   Average length of stay (LOS) in acute inpatient rehab is 12 days

<!-- -->

-   Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF):
    -   Patients admitted to SNF require skilled needs: Wound care, IV
        therapy, Catheter care, PT, OT, and/or SLP
    -   There are no minimal requirements for daily therapy, but
        patients may receive up to 1.5 hrs/day, depending on
        availability at the facility (in practice it is often less than
        this)
    -   Physicians are required to evaluate admitted patients at least
        once every 30 days
    -   Average length of stay is 26 days

<!-- -->

-   Long-Term Acute Care Hospital (LTACH):
    -   Pts admitted to LTACH require extended hospitalization and
        include pts who will be receiving prolonged mechanical
        ventilation
    -   Pts will be recommended for transfer to an LTACH when no
        reasonable functional or medical improvement can be expected in
        an acute inpatient stay
    -   LTACHs can be within a hospital or may be free-standing
    -   Average length of stay must be greater than 25 days

<!-- -->

-   Assisted Living:
    -   Pts receive a combination of long-term housing, personal care
        services, and health care
    -   Designed for individuals who need assistance with activities of
        daily living
    -   Can be provided in freestanding communities, near or integrated
        with SNFs,  hospitals or retirement communities

<!-- -->

-   Outpatient Services:
    -   Can be ordered at discharge with or without official PT/OT
        recommendations
    -   Home health (HH): wide range of healthcare services provided in
        patients home ranging from wound care to IV antibiotics
    -   HH PT/OT: pts can receive therapy at home when unable to attend
        outpatient PT/OT
    -   HH nursing services: required for IV antibiotics or PICC line
        maintenance; consider for wound care, other services include
        medication adherence and reconciliation
    -   HH non-skilled aide: outside the scope of acute hospitalization,
        but helps with ADLs
    -   Outpatient PT/OT: Consider for those who would benefit from
        therapy but do not meet the qualifications for other
        dispositions or would prefer outpatient therapy
        -   Pt would attend therapy sessions at an outpatient clinic
        -   If a pt is receiving other HH services, they do not qualify
            for outpatient PT/OT
