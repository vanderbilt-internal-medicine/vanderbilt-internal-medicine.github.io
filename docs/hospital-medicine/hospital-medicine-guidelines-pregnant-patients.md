    obstruction, pancreatitis, pyelonephritis, nephrolithiasis, ovarian
    torsion, DKA, hyperparathyroidism, migraines, preeclampsia
-   Workup: BMP, mg, phos, LFTs, lipase (may be mildly elevated in HG),
    UA,
-   Treatment:
    -   -   First Line: Ginger, doxylamine (25mg PO q6), pyridoxine
            (20mg PO q6)
        -   Second Line: metoclopramide (10mg q6), Promethazine (12.5mg
            q6)
        -   Third Line: ondansetron (8mg q12hrs, after 1st trimester)
        -   Hydration: 1L LR on admission + banana bag q24hrs

Hypertension:

-   Both gestational HTN and preeclampsia/HELLP are typically
    diagnosed >20w GA
-   Tx options: nifedipine, labetalol, methyldopa, hydral (2
    <sup>nd</sup> line), clonidine (2 <sup>nd</sup> line)
-   Avoid: ACEs, ARBs, MRAs, Nitroprusside

Diabetes:

-   Due to hormonal changes associated with pregnancy, pregnant patients
    are at higher risk for poor control and DKA
-   Oral regimens are generally transitioned to insulin-based regimens.

GERD:

-   1st Line: Can use antacids; avoid sodium bicarbonate and magnesium
    trisilicate

-   3rd Line: Cimetidine 200mg (30min prior to eating)

Asthma:

-   Similar rescue and controller medications as in non-pregnant patient
