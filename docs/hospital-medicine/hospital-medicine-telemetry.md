# Telemetry 

Ashley Ciosek 

---

## Background
- Many monitored pts do not have a true indication
    - Leads to alarm fatigue, unnecessary workups, and is expensive
    - Cost: about $110 per patient per day
- Telemetry is not a substitute for more frequent vital signs
- Discuss frequently on rounds: reassess need and indication
- Select “MAY” for transfers off telemetry and showering off telemetry among stable patients without troponin elevation or new arrythmia
