# Thyroid Storm 

Gaby Schroeder

---

## Background
-	Diagnosis is based on recognition of exaggerated signs/symptoms of thyrotoxicosis leading to multi-organ dysfunction in the setting of precipitating event
-	Common Precipitants: Grave’s Disease, surgery, trauma, pregnancy, stress, infection, MI/PE, medication non-compliance, iodine loads
-	Use Burch-Wartofsky Point Scale (BWPS); available on MD Calc
    - &gt;highly suggestive
    - &gt;25-44 impending storm
    - <25 unlikely to represent storm 

## Management
-	ENDOCRINE EMERGENCY - if suspected consult Endocrine ASAP 
-	Therapies directed towards thyroid gland
    -	PTU: Preferred, 500-1000mg loading dose, followed by 250mg q4 -6 hours (PO, rectal)
    -	Methimazole: q4-6 hours, dose varies (PO, rectal, IV)
-	Therapies directed toward decreasing T4 to T3 conversion
    -	Propranolol (60-80mg PO q4)
    -	Hydrocortisone (300mg x1, 100mg q8) - treats high incidence of co-existing adrenal insufficiency
-	Cholestyramine 4g QID can be considered to reduce enteric recirculation
-	Refractory Storm: plasmapheresis and plasma exchange 
-	Close hemodynamic monitoring, may need vasopressors (consider transfer to ICU)
