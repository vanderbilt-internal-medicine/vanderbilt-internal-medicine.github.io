# Adrenal Insufficiency

Adrenal Insufficiency – Griffin Bullock

Background

-   Differential: Primary (Adrenals) vs Secondary (Pituitary):
    -   Exogenous steroid use (>10 mg for >3wks) undergoing severe
        physiologic stress or sudden discontinuation of steroid
    -   Critical Illness (not consensus)
    -   Autoimmune Adrenal Insufficiency
    -   Infection/Infiltration: tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, malignancy
    -   Hemorrhage (Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome)
    -   Pituitary mass/tumor, infarct, infiltration, surgery
    -   Trauma

Presentation

-   Generalized weakness, lightheaded, abdominal pain, nausea, weight
    loss, fatigue
-   Symptoms are often vague and non-specific. More common in chronic
    disease
-   Lab Abnormalities: Hyponatremia, Hyperkalemia, Hypoglycemia
-   Shock (adrenal crisis) unresponsive to vasopressors, volume, or
    refractory

Evaluation

-   Inpatient Setting: ACTH stimulation test and ACTH lvl with baseline
    lab draw
-   High-dose stimulation 250 mcg:
    #
    cortisol
    ≥
    18-20 rules out primary, most secondary
-   Outpatient Setting: morning serum cortisol concentration (>15 mcg/dL
    wnl) for screening
    -   ACTH stimulation for confirmation

Management

-   If concerned about adrenal crisis, treat and figure out testing
    later):
-   When to consult/refer to Endocrine:
    -   If testing is abnormal
    -   If clinical suspicion is high and testing is indeterminate
-   Adrenal Crisis:
    -   BMP, glucose monitoring, ACTH level, serum cortisol/ACTH
        stimulation test
    -   Fluid resuscitation: isotonic fluid (2-3 L). do not use
        hypotonic saline
    -   Dexamethasone 4 mg immediately then q12h or other stress dose
        steroid
    -   ACTH stimulation (confirmatory)
    -   Consult Endocrine
    -   Further workup of cause, mineralocorticoid replacement
