    Graves’ disease, Toxic goiter, TSH-producing adenoma, hyperemesis
    gravidarum, subacute granulomatous thyroiditis, amiodarone,
    radiation, excessive replacement, struma ovarii
-   Low TSH/Normal T4 and T3
    : Subclinical hyperthyroidism, central hypothyroidism, non-thyroidal
    illness, recovery from hyperthyroidism, pregnancy (physiologic)
-   Subclinical Hyperthyroidism
    : repeat testing to verify abnormality is not transient

Presentation

-   Anxiety/emotional lability, weight loss, heat intolerance, tremor,
    palpitations, increased appetite, unexplained weight loss, new onset

Evaluation

-   TSH
    , free T4, free T3 (only T3 or T4 may be elevated, though both often
    are)
    -   Biotin affects assay, causes falsely
        ↓
        TSH and falsely
        ↑
        FT4/FT3
-   CBC: May have a normocytic anemia due to increased plasma volume

Management

-   Thyrotropin antibodies (Graves: specific test, not sensitive)
-   Radioiodine uptake scan if thyrotropin antibodies negative
-   Thyroidal blood flow evaluation on US (pregnancy)
-   Treatment: methimazole, PTU, Radioiodine ablation, surgery
    -   Pts should be referred to endocrinology for treatment plan based
