Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) – Will Bassett

Background

-   Classically
    in type 1 diabetes but can also occur in insulin-dependent type 2
    diabete
-   Definition:
    ↑
    blood glucose (typically >350) w/ high anion gap and ketones in
    blood/urine
-   If glucose is significantly elevated but no ketones/anion gap
    present, you likely have HHS
    -   ↑
        serum osm and BG > 600 commonly seen

Evaluation

-   Workup aimed at discovering the underlying cause (The "I’s"):
    -   I
        nfection/ **I** nflammation - CBC, CXR, UA/UCx, LFTs; consider
        BCx, lipase (pancreatitis). NB leukocytosis will be present in
        most DKA pts
    -   I
        schemia (MI, CVA, mesenteric ischemia) - EKG, Troponin, CT if
        clinical suspicion
    -   I
        ntoxication - Ethanol (can cause ketosis with or without
        acidosis)
    -   I
        mpregnation - Beta HCG if appropriate
    -   I
        nsulin-openia/ **I** atrogenic: steroids, other meds, insulin
        delivery failure (pump failure, insulin degraded by heat, etc)

<!-- -->

-   ABG (for pH), serum osmolality
-   Check a phosphate at least once to ensure severe hypophosphatemia
    (\<1mg/dL)
-   Remember to correct sodium for hyperglycemia (Na + 2.4 mEq \*
    (BG-100))

Management

-   Initial monitoring: Q2h BMPs (monitor K closely), Q1h fingersticks
    -   Can space less frequently once gap is closed x 2 and patient off
        insulin infusion
-   Ensure IV access and make NPO
-   Start IV fluids, insulin, and potassium as below
    -   Lactated ringers’ preferred fluid if no contraindication
    -   Dextrose gtt should be started when BG \<200
    -   Turn off insulin drip when anion gap is closed on 2 consecutive
        BMPs
-   Once BG\<200 can start clear liquid diet and advance as tolerated.
    When pt is able to tolerate PO, dextrose infusion can stop
-   Consult endocrinology early, even though you’ve got it under control

Additional Information

-   Patients on insulin drip can be admitted to stepdown (8MCE) with
    order set
-   “ADULT DKA RESUSCITATION ADMISSION ORDERS”
-   Start subcutaneous long-acting insulin as soon as insulin drip/IV
    insulin is started. Either home long-acting insulin (reduced for NPO
    if necessary) or, if insulin naive, Lantus 0.2-0.3 u/kg/day (0.1 if
    AKI in T1DM, 0.3 if obese-- can possibly take more but safe start)
-   Make sure PRN dextrose source is ordered for all patients on insulin
    drip
-   Pts are usually deficient in total body K <sup>+</sup> , even if
    serum \[K <sup>+</sup> \] is high
