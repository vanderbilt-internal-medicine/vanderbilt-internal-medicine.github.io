# Brown Recluse Bites (Loxoscelism)

Ashley Zeoli

---

## Background

- Only a handful of spiders are truly harmful to humans
- The brown recluse (a member of the Loxoceles genus) is widespread in
    the South, West, and Midwest US
- They are often found in homes (attics, basements, cupboards) and
    outdoors (rock piles and under tree bark)
- Their numbers increase in association with humans (i.e.
    synanthropic)
- Appearance/identification:
    - Brown recluses have three pairs of eyes, a monochromatic abdomen and
    legs, and very fine hairs on its legs
    - Using the “violin” pattern on its body is a poor way to identify
    this spider, as other harmless spiders can have similar markings.
- Loxocelism is the medical manifestation of the brown recluse spider
    bite
- Venom contains insecticidal toxins, metalloproteases, and
    phospholipases

## Presentation

- Bites are most common on the upper arm, thorax, or inner thigh
- Local signs:
    - Sometimes painless, but can cause burning sensation with two small
    cutaneous puncture marks with surrounding erythema. Pain can
    increase over the first 8 hours
    - Usually appears as a red plaque or papule with central pallor and
    can sometimes present with vesiculation
    - Usually self-resolves in 1 week
- Skin necrosis:
    - In some, skin lesion can progress to necrosis overall several days
    - An eschar will form that eventually ulcerates
    - Usually will heal over several weeks to months
- Systemic signs:
    - The degree of systemic effects does not correlate with the
    appearance of the bite
    - Symptoms may develop over several days, and include nausea,
    vomiting, fever, rhabdomyolysis, malaise, acute hemolytic anemia,
    significant swelling from head/neck bites that can compromise the
    airway, DIC and renal failure

## Evaluation

- Presumptive diagnosis is based clinical presentation of the
    bite/wound
- DDx includes vasculitis, pyoderma gangrenosum, cellulitis, or other
    arthropod bites
- Definitive diagnosis is based upon observing a spider bite in
    combination identification by an entomologist. There is an assay for
    Loxoceles venom, but it is not commercially available
- Patients with local symptoms do not need any further workup
- Patient with any systemic symptoms require lab evaluation for more
    serious disease:
    - CBC, UA to eval for blood, CMP, CK
    - If anemia: Type and Screen, peripheral smear, reticulocyte count,
    LDH, haptoglobin, coags to evaluate for hemolysis or DIC

## Management

- Local signs:
    - Wound care (soap/water, elevation)
    - Pain management
    - Tetanus vaccine/prophylaxis if indicated
    - Antibiotics only if signs of concurrent cellulitis
- Skin necrosis:
    - Symptomatic and supportive care
    - Surgical intervention can worsen cosmetic outcomes and is rarely
    indicated in the acute care setting. Skin grafting is occasionally
    needed for a very large ulcerative wound that is not healing.
    Infection is rare, Furthermore, the ulcerative base of the wounds
    often have a yellow stringy material that is not pus or infection.
    Please call Toxicology with any questions regarding brown recluse
    bites
- Systemic signs: Targeted at treatment of symptoms that develop (Consult toxicology)
    - Hemolytic anemia: transfuse for Hgb <10 + consult heme
    - Rhabdomyolysis: LR for UOP >200-300cc/hr
    - If patient develops chest pain, obtain EKG and check a troponin; if
        either is abnormal please obtain echo and call Toxicology as heart
        effects (i.e. myocarditis) is something we have been seeing at VUMC
    - DIC: supportive care
