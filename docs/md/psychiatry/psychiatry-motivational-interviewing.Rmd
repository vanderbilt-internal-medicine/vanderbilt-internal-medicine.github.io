Motivational Interviewing (MI) – Barrington Hwang, <span

Background

-   MI:  an evidence-based form of non-judgmental, pt-centered
    counseling that elicits change in pt behavior by guiding pt through
    own motivations for change
-   For inpatients, MI is most useful for encouraging medication
    compliance before discharge or substance use cessation
-   Assumptions/principles:
    -   Pt is in state of ambivalence, whether outwardly expressed or
        not
    -   Ambivalence is expressed with conflict between multiple courses
        of action
-   Pt may go between stages of change at any given time, some pts may
    benefit from explaining this model of behavior change
-   Techniques to identify ambivalence:
    -   Focus
        on reasons to change ("why") as opposed to specific actions
        ("how")
    -   Express empathy: discussion about values, hopes, emotions, and
        goals surrounding behavior
    -   Empower self-efficacy: ask about other times they have made
        changes in life
    -   Develop discrepancy - between current and desired behavior
    -   Avoid argument and authoritarian mentality - consider "asking"
        for permission to give your own thoughts, don't "give advice"
    -   Defuse resistance to change - emphasize pt autonomy and reflect
        on resistance

Evaluation

-   Stages of behavior change:
    -   Precontemplation - pt does not intend to change and has not
        taken action toward behavior change; could be related to
        demoralization from prior attempts
    -   Contemplation - pt intends to change, but has not taken action,
        usually related to awareness of risks vs benefits of change
    -   Preparation - pt intends to change, has taken steps to create
        plan and mental action, but no current physical action toward
        behavior change
    -   Action - pt intends to change, currently following through on
        plan
    -   Maintenance - pt intends to change, has changed, and is taking
        steps to prevent relapse
-   Continuing the Conversation:
    -   May be effective to have SMART goal-setting if pt is in any
        stage except precontemplation: Specific, Measurable, Attainable,
        Realistic, Time-limited
    -   Pts may benefit from discussion on specific defense mechanisms
    -   "OARS" interviewing skills: Open-ended questions, Affirm,
        Reflect, Summarize
    -   Most effective in conjunction with other treatments, when pts
        are willing, and when pts express ideas for change themselves
    -   Least effective in
        group format and when pt feels change comes from authority
