Acute Asthma Exacerbation 

Stacy Blank

---

## Presentation

- History of asthma or a history concerning for asthma

- Progressive worsening of symptoms: dyspnea, chest tightness,
    wheezing, and cough

- Physical exam with wheezing, poor air movement, tachypnea, increased
    work of breathing, hypoxemia

- Often use of peak flows is cited in the literature (PEF \<200 L/min
    or PEF \<50% predicted indicates severe obstruction, PEF \<70%
    predicted indicates moderate exacerbation)

    - May be useful although often does not change management acutely

## Evaluation

- Generally aimed at ruling out causes for exacerbation and other
    diagnoses; these are not required but should be considered in pts
    being admitted for inpatient management:

    - EKG, trop, BNP, D-dimer to assess for cardiac cause (ACS, CHF, PE)

    - CXR to rule out underlying process (PNA, PTX, atelectasis)

    - ABG/VBG not routinely needed unless ill-appearing, tachypneic, or
        lethargic/altered

- Dangerous signs and possible ICU if:

    - Tachypnea \>30 and/or significantly increased work-of-breathing

    - Hypercapnia or even normocapnia (these pts are usually
        hyperventilating; a normal CO2 in a severe asthma exacerbation could
        indicate impending respiratory failure)

    - Altered mental status

    - Requiring continuous nebulizers

## Management

- Continuous pulse ox with oxygen therapy to maintain O2 \>92 %

- Continuous albuterol nebulizer or Duonebs until able to space to
    q1h\>\>q2h, etc

- Steroids with dosing based on severity of illness (there is no data
    behind exact dosing of steroids).

    - Start with IV methylpred 125mg q6h in severe exacerbation/ICU
        patients

    - Can start with oral prednisone 60mg q12h in less severe
        exacerbation/floor pts

    - Plan to transition from IV to PO and then likely to send pt home to
        finish course of 40-60 mg pred daily for 5-7 days.

- IV mag sulfate 4g over 20 minutes for severe exacerbation

- Keep pt NPO until off continuous nebs/respiratory effort is
    improved. Consider IV fluids with pt’s comorbidities (HFrEF, renal
    disease) vs. increased insensible losses with resp effort

- If pt is not responding to therapies, has worsening respiratory
    status, or blood gas concerning for respiratory acidosis needs ICU
    care for BiPAP vs mechanical ventilation

- Note: We do not start empiric antibiotics unless there is concern
    for bacterial infection

## Prior to discharge:

- Ensure that pt is on appropriate controller medications (see
    outpatient management)

- Evaluate for causes of acute exacerbation to prevent future events
    (noncompliance, resp viruses, allergies, exposures, etc.)
