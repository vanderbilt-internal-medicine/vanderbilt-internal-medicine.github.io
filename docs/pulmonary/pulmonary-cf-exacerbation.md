| Cystic Fibrosis (CF) Exacerbation |

All admissions:

-   “Cystic Fibrosis” Admission order set in epic, contains most orders
    and labs below
-   Enter “Pulmonary, Cystic Fibrosis” Consult in Epic, exception is on
    Rogers Pulmonary if the attending specializes in CF
-   Pancreatic enzymes (most pts are on them), order at bedside for pt
    administration
-   Always continue ADEK vitamins
-   Consult nutrition (There is a specific Radio Button in the nutrition
    consult order for CF)
-   Send sputum culture for bacterial, AFB and Fungus if not sent from
    clinic
    -   Specify “CF Resp” when prompted
-   CXR PA and Lat – especially if new sharp chest pains
-   Order all home inhaler and airway clearance (AWC) therapies (See
    Sputum Clearance below), ask about compliance with these therapies
    at home
-   All CF pts are placed on contact precautions
-   Always ask about coughing up blood and amount -- see 'Hemoptysis'
    section if present
-   Sputum clearance: albuterol nebs, pulmozyme (if on at home),
    hypertonic saline (if on at home), Vest and/or Acapella, CPD as last
    choice since not as effective (pts like it)
-   CF modulators (e.g., ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elaxacaftor): continue if
    on at home;  place non-formulary order so pt can use own supply;
    time with fat rich meal for absorption

Malnutrition:

-   Common and improves with treatment of infectious exacerbation
-   Daily to 3 times a week weight checks
-   Nutrition consult as above

DIOS - Distal Intestinal Obstruction Syndrome:

-   Treat with Miralax and/or Golytely
-   Often looks like mechanical obstruction
-   RARELY surgery, try medical management first

CF Pneumonia admission:

-   Continue tobramycin nebs (if on that month) and MWF Azithromycin
    unless otherwise contraindicated if they are on these therapies at
    home
-   Check RVP, and treat with oseltamivir if flu+
-   Use Epic Order Adult Cystic Fibrosis order set for Antibiotic/dosing
-   Look at last admission, last CF note, culture data – MRSA, MSSA, and
    Pseudomonas are by far the most common
    -   If they were recently admitted and improved on that antibiotic
        regimen, it is usually a good empiric choice
-   If MRSA then Vancomycin 1G q8h (okay to consult Pharm for dosing)
    -   if Vanc allergic then Bactrim DS-2 TID or Linezolid
-   Assume all pts are colonized with Pseudomonas. Empirically double
    cover with:
    -   Something from Penicillin class (Cephalosporin, carbapenem,
        extended penicillin)
    -   Aminoglycoside or Ciprofloxacin
-   CF team -- there is no fellow for this, so don’t worry when you have
    to page an attending
    -   They will guide all antibiotics decisions following admission
        (check outpt clinic note)
    -   Doses are not normal, do not use Sanford:
        -   Aztreonam: 2 gm q 6 hours (good for Pen allergic)
        -   Cefepime 2 gm q 8 hours
        -   Ceftazidime 4 gms q 8 hours
        -   Cipro 750 mg po bid or 400 mg IV q 8
        -   Imipenem 1 gm q 6-8 hours
        -   Meropenem 2 gm q 8 hours 2 hr infusion
        -   Doripenem 1 gm q 8 hours 2 hr infusion
        -   Piperacillin/tazo (Zosyn) 4.750 gm q 6 hours 4 h infusion
        -   Tobramycin 10mg/kg q 24 hours
        -   Can consult pharmacy for Tobramycin dosing, but check renal
            function first
