| Pulmonary Hypertension – Kaele Leonard |

Background

-   Symptoms: dyspnea, exertional chest pain, fatigue, edema (legs,
    abdomen), exertional lightheadedness or syncope, palpitation
-   Exam: JVD, increased P2, split S2, RV heave, TR murmur,
    hepatomegaly, ascites, edema
-   Signs of RV failure: low cardiac output (hypotension, renal failure,
    hepatic congestion), arrhythmias, refractory hypoxemia (R→L shunt),
    effusions (pericardial > pleural)
-   WHO Groups and Causes:

1.  Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH): obliteration of blood vessels
    in the lung
    -   Idiopathic, heritable
    -   Drugs/toxins (methamphetamine)
    -   Associated with CTD, HIV, portal HTN, congenital heart disease,
        schistosomiasis
    -   Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD), pulmonary capillary
        hemangiomatosis
2.  Left heart disease: back pressure and passive congestion
    -   HFrEF, HFpEF, valvular disease, LA stiffness
3.  Chronic lung disease: chronic hypoxemia
    à
    chronic pulmonary vasoconstriction
    -   COPD, ILD, OSA, chronic high-altitude, developmental lung
        disorders
4.  Pulmonary artery obstruction and thrombi: obstruction due to chronic
    clot material
    -   Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH)
5.  Unclear or multifactorial mechanisms
    -   Hematologic disorders, chronic hemolytic anemia, sarcoidosis,
        pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis, fibrosing
        mediastinitis, metabolic disorders

Evaluation

-   Consult pulmonary hypertension with any questions or assistance with
    workup. Below are studies to consider ordering to determine
    etiology/group of pulmonary hypertension
-   Labs: BNP, rheumatologic studies (ANA, RF), HIV
-   CXR: increased right heart border, increased PA
-   EKG: RVH
    , RAD
-   TTE w/ bubble: RVSP >35-40, RV dilation and dysfunction, RA
    dilation, septal flattening, pericardial effusion, evaluate for L
    heart disease and shunt
-   PFTs: decreased DLCO in PH, evaluate for parenchymal lung disease
-   VQ scan
    or CTA chest: evaluate for CTEPH
    -   Pulmonary angiogram (evaluate for surgical candidacy for
        pulmonary endarterectomy)
-   \+
    CT chest: evaluate for parenchymal lung disease
-   \+
    ABG: evaluate for hypoxemia or hypercarbia
-   \+
    Sleep
    study: evaluate for OSA

Right heart catheterization (RHC): diagnose PH and determine pre- vs
post-capillary

-   See RHC section for hemodynamic assessment
-   Nitric oxide challenge assess for drug response
-   Fluid challenge
    →
    assess left heart compliance

| Pre-capillary PH                     | mPAP \> 20 mmHg PAWP ≤ 15 mmHg PVR ≥ 3 WU   | Groups 1, 3, 4, 5 |
| Post-capillary PH                    | mPAP \> 20 mmHg PAWP \> 15 mmHg PVR \< 3 WU | Group 2           |
| Combined pre- and post- capillary PH | mPAP \> 20 mmHg PAWP \> 15 mmHg PVR ≥ 3 WU  | Group 2, 5        |

Management

-   General: treat underlying cause; Diuretics for right heart failure;
    Oxygen goal SpO2 > 90%
-   PAH medicines: Consult pulmonary hypertension for consideration to
    start or change thes
    -   Oral treatments may be used as monotherapy or in combination
        -   Calcium-channel blockers
            →
            patients with + vasoreactive challenge
        -   NO-cGMP enhancers: PDE5-inhibitors sildenafil or tadalafil,
            riociguat
        -   Endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs): bosentan,
            macitentan, ambrisenta
        -   Prostacyclins:
        -   Epoprostenol: IV (Veletri) or inhaled (Flolan), half-life 4
            minutes
        -   Treprostinil: IV/subcutaneous/inhaled/PO, half-life 4 hours
        -   Iloprost: inhaled, half-life minutes
        -   Selexipag (Uptravi): PO, half-life hours
        -   Side effects: headache, jaw pain, flushing, diarrhea,
            arthralgias
-   Treatment based on NYHA functional classification:
    -   Class I: no treatment or monotherapy
    -   Class II: monotherapy or combination oral therapy
    -   Class III: combination oral therapy or prostacyclin
    -   Class IV: prostacyclin +/- oral therapy
-   Lung transplant for patients who are candidates and failing maximal
    medical therapy
-   V-A ECMO can be used as bridge to medical therapy or lung transplant
-   Palliative
    measures
    -   Atrial septostomy – serves as “pop-off” valve and allows for
        decompression of failing RV; used as definitive palliative
        procedure or bridge to lung transplant
