| Interstitial Lung Disease – Gaby Schroeder |

Background

-   MANY CAUSES, one mnemonic to use:
    -   S
        arcoidosis
    -   H
        ypersensitivity Pneumonitis
    -   I
        diopathic Interstitial Pneumonias (IIPs- UIP/IPF, NSIP, OP,
        RB-ILD, DIP, LIP, AIP)
    -   T
        uberculosis
    -   F
        ungal
    -   A
        spiration/ Asbestosis (and other Pneumoconiosis)
    -   C
        onnective Tissue Disease + Cancer
    -   E
        osinophilic Pneumonia
    -   D

Evaluation

-   History: Ask about 1) Duration, timing, severity of primary
    respiratory symptoms 2) Exposures: Pets, Occupation, Residence,
    Mold, Feathers, Smoking, Illicits, Travel, Hobbies, Medications
    (especially amiodarone, nitrofurantoin and chemotherapies) 3)
    Symptoms of systemic autoimmune disease 4) Family history
-   Chest Imaging: HRCT is best for characterization, but often not
    achievable or desirable in inpatient setting when patients are
    critically ill.
-   Labs:
    -   Rule out fungal infection: Histo Antigen, Blasto Antigen,
        Aspergillus Galactomannan, 1,3-
        β
        -D-Glucan, sputum GMS (orderable as 'Cytology/Pneumocystis
        Stain')
    -   Rheumatologic Work Up: ANA w/ Reflex, CK, Aldolase, consider
        full myositis panel
        -   -   RA: RF, Anti-CCP
            -   Scleroderma: Anticentromere, Anti-SCL-70
            -   Mixed Connective Tissue Disease: Anti-ribonuclear
                protein
            -   DM/PM: Anti-Jo
            -   SLE: Anti-ds DNA, Anti-sm, APL
            -   Sjogren: Anti-SS-A (Ro), Anti-SS-B (La)
    -   If risk factors present: Sputum AFB, Hypersensitivity Panel
-   PFTs, 6-minute walk test
-   Bronchoscopy: BAL (Cell counts, cultures, cytology) + Tissue Biopsy
    (Transbronchial vs. Cryobiopsy vs. surgical/VATS)

Management

-   Treat underlying condition
-   In the inpatient setting, often determine if a patient would benefit
    from immunosuppression therapy (i.e. steroids) initially, but will
    need to rule out to infection first
-   Consider lung transplantation for rapidly progressive or refractory
    cases in appropriate candidate

Primary Respiratory Acidosis:

-   Assess patient’s history: Is this acute or chronic?
    -   Acute respiratory acidosis and hypercarbia will often present
        with somnolence or AMS
    -   Similarly, if a PCO2 is 80, and the patient is talking to you,
        it is most likely chronic
-   Common Acute Causes: Decreased respiratory drive (opiates,
    intoxication) or respiratory muscle weakness (i.e. myasthenia gravis
    exacerbation)
-   Common Chronic Causes: COPD, sleep apnea
-   Appropriate metabolic compensation?
-   If acute, every 10 mmHg increase in pCO2 above normal (40) should
    raise HCO3 by 1
    -   Expected HCO3 = 24 + ((pCO2 -40)/10))
-   If chronic, every 10 mm Hg
    ↑
    in pCO2 above normal (40) should raise HCO3 by 3.5
    -   Expected HCO3 = 24 + 3.5 ((pCO2-40/10)).
-   If HCO3 higher than expected
    à
    additional metabolic alkalosis
