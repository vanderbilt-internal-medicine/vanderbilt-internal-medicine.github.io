# AMS

Delirium & Altered Mental Status (AMS)

Background

-   Why delirium matters:
    -   Increased morbidity
    -   Hospital complications, falls, infection, prolonged mechanical
        ventilation
    -   ADL dependence and long-term functional impairment
    -   Long-term cognitive impairment
    -   Psychiatric (depression 4x more common than PTSD) and impaired
        Quality of Life
-   Departure
    from pt’s baseline cognition: hypoactive (lethargic) or hyperactive
    (agitated)
-   Risk factors:
    -   Functional impairment
    -   Age > 75
    -   Dementia
    -   Depression
    -   ETOH use disorder
    -   Sensory impairment
    -   Surgery (repair of aortic aneurysm, trauma, NSGY, thoracic
        surgery)

<!-- -->

-   Consider MOVE STUPID mnemonic:
    -   Metabolic
        (Hypo/hypernatremia, Hypercalcemia)
    -   Oxygen
        (Hypoxia)
    -   Vascular
        (CVA, Bleed, MI, CHF)
    -   Endocrine
        (Hypoglycemia, Thyroid)
    -   Seizure
        (postictal state)
    -   Trauma (concussion)
    -   Uremia
    -   Psychogenic
    -   Infection
    -   Drugs
        - intoxication or withdrawal

Evaluation

-   Screening
    Tools:
    -   Wards
        : bCAM: Brief-Confusion Assessment Method
    -   ICU: CAM-ICU: Confusion Assessment Method for ICU
-   Broad toxic/metabolic/infectious workup
    -   TSH, Vitamin B12, CMP, UA, chest X-ray, seasonal infection
        testing
-   Review
    of medications-> sedatives, anticholinergics, central alpha
    agonists/antagonists, benzos/EtOH toxicity or withdrawal (check home
    med list to ensure something like chronic benzos weren’t held on
    admission)
-   Head imaging in the setting of focal neurologic findings
    -   CT helps to identify hemorrhage and large structural lesions;
        strokes take up to 24 hours to show up on CT
        -   Some strokes can cause AMS without other obvious focal signs
    -   MRI: stroke, inflammatory changes or infectious changes more
        clearly w/ contrast
-   LP should be performed if there is any concern for meningitis
    -   For meningitis, empirically treat with acyclovir/vanc/CTX at
        minimum, + ampicillin if old or young for Listeria coverage
-   EEG is reasonable with fluctuating mental status or seizure-like
    activity
-   Catatonia (Bush-Francis scale is a 24-point scale that covers
    features of catatonia)

Management

-   First line, Nonpharmacologic interventions: **HOMMEEESS**
    -   H
        ydration/nutrition:
        -   Ensure patient fed, hold diuretics if poor PO intake, rule
            out constipation and urinary retention
    -   O
        rientation
    -   M
        obilize out of bed 3x/daily as able, PT/OT
    -   M
        anage pain
    -   E
        liminate unnecessary devices (restraints, catheters, tele,
        lines) and meds
    -   E
        nvironmental modification
        -   Minimize devices, lights on/windows open during day

        ensory restoration: use eyeglasses and hearing aids and reorient
    -   S
        leep protocol
        -   Minimize nighttime vitals, earplugs, sleep mask and no TV at
            nigh
