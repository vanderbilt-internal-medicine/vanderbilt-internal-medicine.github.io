# Brain Masses

Brain Masses

Background

-   Neoplasm is the biggest concern: \~ 90% of malignant brain masses
    are metastatic
-   Other etiologies: abscess, tumefactive demyelinating lesions,
    vascular malformations, sometimes other causes of edema (e.g.
    paraneoplastic)
-   Most common metastatic brain tumors: lung, RCC, breast, and melanoma
-   Tumors with high bleeding risk: melanoma, thyroid, choriocarcinoma,
    and RCC
-   Gliomas: WHO Grade I-IV, with IV being glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)
    -   GBM appears as large heterogeneous masses with edema;
        heterogenous contrast enhancement; can cross the corpus callosum
    -   Lower grade gliomas, which includes oligodendrogliomas and
        astroytomas
-   Meningioma – usually low grade and either left alone and monitored,
    but can be symptomatic in which they are resected/radiated
-   Ependymoma – uncommon, usually lower grade can cause CSF outflow
    obstruction
-   CNS lymphoma – diffuse WM involvement, with mass effect, restricts
    diffusion on MRI with prominent contrast enhancement. Can also cross
    the corpus callosum
    -   Usually B-cell, initially responds significantly to steroids

Presentation

-   A significant number of brain lesions are detected incidentally
-   If a pt has a first-time seizure, brain mass needs to be ruled out
-   HA (usually constant, severe), seizure and focal neurologic deficits

Evaluation/Management

-   Imaging: MRI w/ and w/o contrast provides the most information
    -   Findings suggesting malignant lesions: marked edema, multifocal
        lesions, or presence at gray-white junctions
-   LP may be indicated if herniation risk is low, particularly if
    concerned for infection
-   Biopsy will ultimately be needed in most cases, which is done
    through NSGY

Management

-   Work up for primary malignancy, CT C/A/P <u><sub>+</sub></u> PET
-   Steroids are generally indicated for treatment of edema
    -   Decadron 10 mg IV to start; then transition to 4mg IV q6h with
        SSI
-   If seizure develops would treat as outlined in seizure section
-   Symptomatic tumors need eval by NSGY for resection consideration
-   Other options include radiation, which does happen as inpatient but
    it is rare
