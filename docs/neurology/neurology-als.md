# ALS
 
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)

Background

-   Progressive weakness, often asymmetric and profound with no sensory
    loss
-   Combination of LMN and UMN findings
    -   LMN findings: weakness, flaccidity, absent/decreased reflexes,
        fasciculations
    -   UMN findings: weakness, spasticity, hyperreflexia, pathologic
        reflexes (e.g. extensor plantar response), slow movements
-   Pts with bulbar symptoms may complain of difficulty swallowing,
    changes in their voice, or increased saliva production (they just
    aren’t swallowing it)
-   Tongue fasciculations are fairly uncommon in other disorders and is
    a good clue for ALS if present (these can be hard to be certain of –
    tongue movements that are symmetric are typically not
    fasciculations)
-   Pseudobulbar affect – inappropriate laughing or crying; relatively
    common in ALS
-   FVC is an important marker for function

Evaluation

-   EMG/NCS is gold standard; El Escorial Criteria looks for evidence of
    UMN and LMN findings at cranial, cervical, thoracic and lumbosacral
    levels to determine if ALS or not
-   Exclude mimicking lesions, which may be treatable (see below)

Management

-   Patients with ALS are ideally treated with a multidisciplinary team
    of Neurologists, Pulmonologists, Speech therapists, PT, OT and
    mobility
-   Two medications have been shown to add a few months to survival:
    -   Riluzole - PO med; have to track CBC/LFTs. Side effects: GI and
        general weakness
    -   Edaravone (Radicava) – IV, given daily for 2 weeks every month.
        SE = HA, bruising

Mimics of ALS

-   High cervical spine lesions –UMN changes in upper extremity with LMN
    pattern in LE
-   Primary Lateral Sclerosis – UMN-only disease, much less common with
    much slower progression. Many transition to ALS in the first 1-2
    years, which then is likely a spectrum of the same disease
-   Multifocal Motor Neuropathy – rare autoimmune disorder that looks
    like ALS with LMN signs only, responds to IVIG. Can have anti-GM1 Ab
    in blood. EMG/NCS pattern is different with conduction block
-   Kennedy Disease – X-linked genetic disorder with progressive LMN
    pattern of weakness and endocrine disorders w/androgen resistance
    profile (gynecomastia, defective spermatogenesis)
-   Inclusion Body Myositis – can be asymmetric with grip weakness and
    quadriceps weakness. Biopsy and atrophy pattern usually
    distinguishes it. CPK 500-800.
-   Polymyositis/dermatomyositis – proximal weakness in arms/legs, CPK >
    1000, usually younger onset (30-40s), no UMN signs
