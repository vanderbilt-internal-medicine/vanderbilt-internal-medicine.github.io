# Asthma

## Background

- Typically diagnosed in childhood, but occupational asthma,
    aspirin-induced asthma and eosinophilic asthma are more commonly
    diagnosed in adults

- Three most common symptoms: wheezing after trigger, nighttime cough,
    and associated dyspnea

- COPD-asthma overlap syndromes: newer entity that typically involves
    intermittent symptoms

    - Obstruction is present but does not fully resolve with
        bronchodilator

    - Consider this diagnosis in a pt w/significant smoking history who is
        dx’d with asthma at age \>40yo

## Evaluation

- Ask about triggers: cold, exercise, URIs, allergens, inhaled
        irritants

- Ask about family history or personal history of atopy, eczema,
        allergic rhinitis

- Exam: wheezing, prolonged expiratory phase; nasal polyps, rhinitis,
        eczema

- Spirometry (PFT’s) with reversible obstruction

    - FEV1/FVC \<0.7; \# FEV1 12% and 200 mL after bronchodilator

- “All That Wheezes Is Not Asthma”. Must rule out alternative
        diagnoses:

    - Panic attacks, upper airway obstruction, foreign body, vocal cord
        dysfunction, CHF (cardiac asthma), COPD, ILD

- Consider CBC w/diff to screen for significant anemia and
    eosinophilia (associated w/allergic asthma or eosinophilic
    pneumonia)

- If concerned for allergic asthma or allergic bronchopulmonary
    aspergillosis, consider measuring total serum IgE levels

## Classify Severity and Assess for Symptom Control with the RULE OF 2s:

- Does the patient have symptoms or require rescue inhaler ≥2 times
    per week?

- Does the patient endorse nighttime symptoms ≥ 2 times per month?

- Does the patient have to refill rescue inhaler ≥ 2 times per year?

- Does the patient ever have to limit activity due to asthma symptoms?

## Initial Assessment of Severity:

- Intermittent: No to all of the above and FEV1\> 80% predicted. Start
    at step 1

- Persistent: Yes to any question above. Start at Step 2

    - Mild: Less than daily symptoms, less than weekly nighttime symptoms,
        minor limitation to activities. FEV \>80% predicted

    - Moderate: Daily symptoms, weekly nighttime symptoms, some limitation
        to activities. FEV 60-80% predicted

    - Severe: More severe symptoms than above, FEV1 \<60% predicted

    - Consider referral to pulmonary

## Management

- Aim to use the lowest possible step to maintain symptom control.
    Also consider stepping down therapy if pt has been well-controlled
    for \>3 months

- Prior to escalating therapy, consider:

    - Adherence to therapy (including inhaler technique), uncontrolled
        comorbidities (allergies, GERD, OSA, etc), and alternative diagnoses

    - Ensure patients receive MDI and spacer teaching for full effect

- Updated Guidelines: prn ICS - LABA \> prn SABA Step 1 (mild
    intermittent) and Step 2 (mild persistent)

    - Reduces exacerbations, easier to schedule does in future if needed

    - SYGMA Trial showed rescue/prn Budesonide-formoterol (ICS - LABA)
        non-inferior to daily ICS-LABA + prn SABA in preventing
        exacerbations

- Follow-up

    - Repeat PFTs q3-6 mos after beginning therapy and q1-2 yrs thereafter

- Regular follow up at least q6 mos for all patients with asthma

## VA specific guidance: 

- Mometasone is the formulary ICS and Wixela (fluticasone-salmeterol)
    is the formulary ICS/LABA

- Ordering PFTs: Refer to Pulm section on PFTs for VUMC and VA
    specifics
