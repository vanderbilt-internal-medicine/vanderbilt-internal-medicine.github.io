## Background

- 1º Prevention: pts at increased risk who have not yet had a vascular
    event

- 2º Prevention: pts with pre-existing occlusive vascular disease or
    ASCVD (e.g., stroke, TIA, CAD + angina, ACS, coronary or arterial
    revascularization, PAD)

- Screening: USPSTF 2016 Guidelines: q5years for adults 40-75yrs

    - ACC/AHA 2019 Guideline: adults 20-39 q 4-6yrs; \<21yrs if strong fam
        hx; 40-75 “routinely” assess CV risk and calculate 10 yr ASCVD risk
        (lipid pnl q3-12 months)

    - Dot phrase: .ASCVD2013

## Evaluation

- Fasting vs Non-Fasting Lipid Panel

    - Triglycerides are most impacted by non-fasting testing which can
        artificially lower LDL-C depending on how the laboratory
        measures/calculates LDL. Consider fasting lipid panels when
        triglyceride levels are high

- Consider 2º causes of HLD in initial workup: hypothyroidism, DM,
    EtOH use, smoking, liver disease, nephrotic syndrome, CKD, meds
    (e.g., thiazide, glucocorticoids)

## Management

- Lifestyle changes:

    - Heart Healthy Diet: ↓ trans/saturated fats, choose skim milk,
        low-fat dairy products

    - Emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, poultry, fish, nuts and
        olive oil, while limiting red and processed meats, sodium and
        sugar-sweetened foods and beverages

    - Promote a healthy weight, regular exercise, smoking cessation, limit
        EtOH

    Statin Therapy

    - Initiate as outlined in the following algorithms

    - Check AST/ALT prior to initiation

    - Note that PCE used to estimate ASCVD risk is best validated for
        non-Hispanic whites and blacks. Consider use of additional risk
        prediction tools/factors in other patient populations

# Statin Options

## Statin Side effects:

- Spectrum of statin associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) include
    myalgias, myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, autoimmune myopathy

    - Myalgias: bilateral involving large muscle groups, onset within
        weeks of initiation of therapy and should resolve within weeks of
        cessation; CK should be normal

- Consider evaluation with CK, BMP, TSH, and vitamin D

- ACC has a “Statin Intolerance Calculator” to help assess etiology of
    symptoms

## Additional Information

- If patient is not tolerating a statin, consider:

    - Holding statin until symptoms resolve and trialing lower dose or
        alternative statin (Pravastatin and Fluvastatin may have lower risks
        of myopathy)

    - Every other day dosing with atorvastatin and rosuvastatin (longer
        half-lives)

- If repeated failed attempts, consider alternative agents: Ezetimibe,
    PCSK9 inhibitor

- PCSK9 inhibitor requires referral to Lipid Clinic

## Hypertriglyceridemia:

- Moderate: TG 175-499 mg/dL; Moderate-severe 500 - 999; Severe: TG \>
    1000

- Focus on addressing lifestyle factors and stopping medication that
    increase TG’s (HCTZ, some BB’s, estrogens, some ART, antipsychotics)

- Consider medical therapy when TG\> 500mg/dL (increased risk of
    pancreatitis):

    - Omega-3-fatty acids (icosapent ethyl) 4gms daily or Vascepa 4gm
        daily

    - Fibrates: Fenofibrate 120 mg daily (avoid in CKD), Gemfibrozil 600mg
        bid (increased risk of myopathy with concomitant statin)

## VA- Specific Guidelines

- <https://www.healthquality.va.gov/guidelines/cd/lipids/index.asp>

- Lowest LDL goal recognized for VA Criteria for Use is 100

- Preferred statins: Atorvastatin, Simvastatin, Lovastatin

- Statins that require PADR: Pravastatin, Rosuvastatin (2nd line high
    intensity statin)
    
    - Must have documented intolerances or drug-drug interaction to all
        preferred statins

- Other agents that require PADR:

    - Ezetimibe

        - Pt has tried and failed or not tolerated all statins (allergy,
            AE, etc.)

        - Pt not meeting goal on max dose of statin PLUS bile acid
            sequestrants or niacin

    - Fenofibrate

        - Pt has tried all formulary alternatives or has contraindication
            to use of formulary alternatives (statin, niacin, gemfibrozil,
            cholestyramine, fish oil)

        - If TG \> 500 mg/dL, fenofibrate should be approved
