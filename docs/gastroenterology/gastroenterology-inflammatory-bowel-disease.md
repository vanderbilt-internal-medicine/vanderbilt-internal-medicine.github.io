# Inflammatory Bowel Disease
 
Inflammatory Bowel Disease – Francesca Raffa

Background

-   Ulcerative colitis (UC): colon only (can be backwash ileitis);
    **contiguous** lesions; **mucosal** inflammation
-   Crohn’s disease (CD): any part of the GI tract; “ **skip**
    **lesions** ”; **transmural** inflammation
-   Important historical considerations to include in your documentation
    and presentation:
    -   Location of disease (CD: LB/SB, LB only, SB only; UC: proctitis,
        left-sided or pancolitis)
    -   Complications: Fistulizing, strictures, perianal, prior
        surgeries, current IBD treatment
    -   Include last endoscopies and imaging findings; current and prior
        IBD treatment and reason for transition (SEs, failure), primary
        IBD provider

Presentation

-   UC: frequent diarrhea (often bloody), tenesmus, urgency, abdominal
    pain; may have fever, malaise, and weight loss
    -   Complications: severe bleeding/anemia, fulminant colitis, toxic
        megacolon
-   CD: abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, fever, malaise, weight loss;
    May also have diarrhea (± bloody depending on CD location)
    -   Complications: fistulas (entero-enteric, entero-vesicular,
        entero-cutaneous, rectovaginal, perianal, retroperitoneal),
        abscesses, strictures, obstruction
-   Extra-intestinal (EI): arthritis, sacro-iliitis, uveitis,
    episcleritis, aphthous ulcers, erythema nodosum, pyoderma
    gangrenosum, PSC (esp. UC), nephrolithiasis, thromboembolism

Evaluation

-   CBC w/diff, CMP, CRP, ESR,
    ±
    blood cultures
-   If diarrhea: GI Pathogen panel and C. diff
-   If anemic: obtain iron studies and type & screen
-   If weight loss or concern for malnutrition: albumin, pre-albumin,
    Vitamin D, B12, folate
-   Imaging:
    -   -   CT Enterography (oral contrast) preferred in CD, for
            luminal/extra-luminal complic.
        -   How to order CTE: “CT abdomen pelvis enterography”, order
            barium (Volumen) 0.1% oral suspension x2, 1 <sup>st</sup>
            dose to be given by nurse 60 min before study, 2
            <sup>nd</sup> study to be given 30 min before (nurse should
            be in contact with CT tech)Management

Acute Flare

-   Pain control:
    usually a major component of hospital course
    -   -   Avoid NSAIDs, oral pain medications are preferred
        -   If pain is difficult to control, consider Acute Pain Service
            consult
        -   Narcotics and Imodium are contraindicated in toxic megacolon
-   Antibiotics: appropriately treat infections (intra-abdominal or
    perianal abscess) with antibiotics (consider prior culture data,
    often use cipro/flagyl)
-   VTE Prophylaxis: All IBD patients, even if having blood in stool
    (unless requiring transfusion) as they are at much higher risk of
    VTE
-   Nutrition: Nutrition consult for all IBD patients; For severe
    malnutrition or if prolonged bowel rest is needed, TPN is sometimes
    initiated (discuss w/ fellow or attending before placing a TPN
    consult); If TPN needed, will require PICC line
-   Anemia:
    Ferritin \<100 or iron sat \<20 with ferritin \<300,
    consider iron infusions (if no bacteremia) or transfuse for severe
    anemia
-   Smoking Cessation (esp. with CD): discuss smoking cessation &
    consult tobacco cessation
-   Consult Colorectal Surgery (not EGS):  SBO, toxic megacolon, bowel
    perforation, peritonitis

Immunosuppression: (

Infections must be ruled out and/or treated before starting)

-   First, steroids: methylprednisolone (Solumedrol)- often 20 mg BID
    for three days
    -   -   Transition to oral (40 mg prednisone daily) once clinically
            improved/tolerating PO; typically prescribe a prolonged
            taper on discharge (often down by 5 mg every week)
        -   If severe proctitis: consider rectal steroids
            (hydrocortisone enema/foam)
-   Second
    , if lack of response: additional medical therapy (biologics), bowel
    rest with TPN, or surgical intervention
    -   -   Infliximab (Inflectra) is available at VUMC
        -   If patient fails to respond to steroids, should consider
            possibility of CMV colitis (usually evaluated by biopsy on
            flex sig or colonoscopy)
        -   Biologic workup **:** prior to initiating a biologic, all
            patients must have the following negative studies within the
            last year: Quantiferon Gold and CXR, Hepatitis B serologies,
            HIV, urine histoplasma Ag (some providers)
