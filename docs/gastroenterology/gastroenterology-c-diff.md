# C Diff

Clostridioides difficile Infections – Matthew Meyers

Background

-   Clostridioides difficile is the causative bacteria for
    antibiotic-associated colitis
-   Always consider C. diff in a hospitalized patient with unexplained
    leukocytosis
-   Microbiology: Anaerobic gram-positive, spore-forming,
    toxin-producing bacillus
    -   -   Outside colon, exists in spore form – resistant to heat,
            acid, and antibiotics (why we must wash our hands)
        -   Spores are transferred from environment to person, once in
            intestine convert to functional vegetative, toxin-producing
            forms
            
            susceptible to antibiotics
        -   To be pathogenic, must release toxins to causes colitis and
            diarrhea
-   Risk Factors: Antibiotic use (during use or typically up to 1 month
    after use), age >65, hospitalization, PPI use, enteral feeding,
    obesity, stem cell transplant, chemo, IBD, cirrhosis

Presentation

-   Spectrum from asymptomatic carrier to fulminant colitis with toxic
    megacolon
    -   -   Non-severe disease: watery diarrhea (>3 stools in 24 hours),
            lower abdominal pain, nausea,
            ±
            fever, leukocytosis (WBC \<15,000)
        -   Severe disease: diarrhea, diffuse abdominal pain, abdominal
            distention, fever, lactic acidosis, AKI (Cr > 1.5), marked
            leukocytosis (sometimes >40,000)
        -   Fulminant disease: above + hypotension/shock, ileus (rare),
            or megacolon
-   Recurrent disease: resolution of symptoms on therapy followed by
    reappearance of symptoms within 2-8 weeks after stopping therapy;
    (Up to 25% of patients have recurrence)
-   If symptoms never resolve, consider refractory C. diff or
    alternative diagnosis

Evaluation

-   Several options for lab testing but we have algorithm at VUMC: PCR
    for toxigenic strains (very sensitive, can detect asymptomatic
    carriers w/o toxin production); with reflex EIA (enzyme immunoassay)
    for toxins A and B (specificity of 99%)
    -   PCR (+)/Toxin (-) = carrier
    -   PCR (+ )/Toxin (+) = treat
    -   PCR (-) – no treatment
-   Obtain KUB at least; prefer CT if suspicious for severe disease
-   Endoscopy: Typically used when alternative diagnosis is suspected;
    not warranted for classical symptoms, positive laboratory tests, or
    clinical response to treatment

Management

-   Contact precautions until at least 48 hours after diarrhea resolves
-   Classify patient disease severity to guide treatment algorithm
-   Indications for EGS consult: intestinal perforation, toxic
    megacolon - 7 cm diameter in colon or >12 cm diameter in cecum
-   Do not repeat stool testing – 50% remain positive after treatment up
    to 6 weeks later
-   Initial episode with non-severe disease: Vancomycin 125 mg (some GI
    providers use 250) PO QID x 10 days or fidaxomicin 200 mg PO BID x
    10 days (less recurrence, more $$$)
-   Initial episode with severe disease: above and, if not improving
    after 3-5 days, consider both oral vanc and fidaxomicin, consider
    longer course than 10 days based on severity of disease and
    improvement
-   Initial episode with fulminant disease: vancomycin 500 mg PO QID AND
    metronidazole 500 mg IV q 8 hours
-   If ileus, consider use of rectal vancomycin and fecal microbiota
    transplant
-   Surgery: EGS consult if any of the following are present:
    -   Hypotension, lactic acidosis (>2.2), WBC > 20,000, Fever >=
        38.5C, ileus, abdominal distension, peritoneal signs, admission
        to MICU, mental status changes, end-organ failure, or failure to
        improve after 3-5 days
-   Recurrent disease:
    -   First – oral vancomycin as above (pulse-tapered regimen) or
        fidaxomicin
    -   Second – vancomycin (pulse-tapered), fidaxomicin, or combo
        vancomycin
        
        rifaximin
    -   Third – consider fecal microbiota transplant (currently on hold
        per FDA mandate)
