# Esophageal Disorders

Esophageal Disorders – Caroline Barrett

Dysphagia

-

-   Oropharyngeal dysphagia = difficulty initiating a swallow

-   -   Associated with coughing, choking, nasopharyngeal regurgitation,
        and aspiration

-

-   Causes: Structural (Zenker’s diverticula, malignancy, goiter,
    stricture, radiation injury, infection), Neuromuscular (stroke,
    Parkinson disease, dementia, ALS, MS) Esophageal dysphagia:
    Difficulty swallowing several seconds after initiation; associated
    w/sensation of food getting stuck in esophagus

-   -   Foreign body: Inability to swallow solids and/or liquids,
        including oral secretions
    -   Most common foreign body = food in esophagus

-

-   Dysphagia
    to solids = mechanical obstruction

-   -   Progressive: esophageal stricture, peptic stricture, esophageal,
        cancer
    -   Intermittent: esophageal ring/web, eosinophilic esophagitis
        (particularly in young pts)

-

-   Dysphagia
    to solids and liquids = motility disorder

-   -   Causes: achalasia, scleroderma, distal esophageal spasm (DES),
        hypercontractile (nutcracker) esophagus

Evaluation

-
-   If oropharyngeal dysphagia: videofluoroscopic modified barium
    swallow and fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES)
-   When to order barium esophagram:
    -   Pre-endoscopy if clinical history suspicious for proximal
        esophageal lesion (i.e. Zenker’s) or known complex stricture
        (post-caustic injury or radiation)
        -   Don’t order if a food impaction is suspected or if imminent
            endoscopy
    -   Post-endoscopy if mechanical obstruction is still suspected (EGD
        can miss lower esophageal rings or extrinsic esophageal
        compression)
-   EGD if concerns for mechanical obstruction
-   Manometry for motility disorders

Management

-
-   Food impaction: IV glucagon to relax lower esophageal sphincter to
    allow food passage
    -   Otherwise, requires urgent upper endoscopy for removal
-   Additional management is specific to the final diagnosis

Odynophagia

-
-   Pain with swallowing
-   Associated with esophagitis

PIECE

mnemonic for esophagitis:

-

-   P
    ill-induced: NSAIDs, ART, KCl, doxycycline, bisphosphonates
    -   Discontinue culprit med or substitute with liquid formulation;
        prevent by taking culprit meds w/ 8oz water and sit upright for
        30 mins after

-

-   I
    nfectious: usually in immunosuppressed pts
    -   Candida esophagitis: most common in HIV or heme malignancies,
        pts on antibiotics and steroid use
        -   Can exist without OP thrush.
        -   Diagnosis: white mucosal plaque-like lesions on EGD
            
            biopsy and culture
    -   HSV esophagitis. Occurs most commonly in solid organ, BMT
        transplant recipients, and immunosuppressed patients
        -   Diagnosis: well-circumscribed ulcers on EGD, biopsy or
            brushings of ulcer edge
        -   Rx: acyclovir 400mg PO five times daily for 14-21 days
            (immunocompromised) or acyclovir 5mg/kg IV q8h for 7-14 days
            if unable to tolerate PO; 200mg PO five times daily or 400mg
            PO three times daily for 7-10 days (immunocompetent)

-   -   CMV esophagitis: suspect in HIV pts w/ CD4\<50
        -   Diagnosis: linear/longitudinal ulcers on EGD, biopsy
        -   Rx: ganciclovir 5mg/kg IV q12h for 21-42 days; change to PO
            once pt able to tolerate; If contraindication to ganciclovir
            (leukopenia, thrombocytopenia) can use foscarnet. PO
            valganciclovir can be used in patients who can tolerate and
            absorb oral medications. Treatment duration is 3-6 weeks
            based on expert opinion and response to disease

        E
        osinophilic esophagitis (see below)
    -   C
        austic: alkali-induced injury, acid-induced injury, acute period
        (several days) following esophageal radiofrequency ablation for
        Barrett’s.

GERD

Background

-
-   Condition that develops when reflux of stomach contents causes sxs
    and/or complications
-   Classified base on appearance of esophageal mucosa on EGD
    -   Erosive esophagitis: endoscopically visible breaks in distal
        esophageal mucosa <u>+</u> GERD
    -   Nonerosive reflux disease: presence of sxs of GERD w/o
         esophageal mucosal injury

Presentation

-
-   Esophageal symptoms: heartburn, regurgitation, chest pain,
    dysphagia, globus sensation, odynophagia
    -   Extra-esophageal symptoms: cough, hoarseness
    -   Complications: Esophageal stricture, Barrett’s esophagus,
        esophageal adenocarcinoma

Evaluation

-

-   Dx can often be made clinically in pts with classic heartburn and/or
    regurgitation

-   If dx uncertain, can perform ambulatory pH monitoring <u>+</u>
    impedance

-   EGD indicated for the following:

-   -   Presence of alarm features (dysphagia, persistent vomiting, GI
        cancer in 1º relative, odynophagia, GI bleeding, weight loss,
        iron deficiency anemia, ≥age <u>\></u> 60 y/o with new-onset
        GERD symptoms)
    -   Risk factors for Barrett’s esophagus (duration of GERD at least
        5-10 years \[must be present\], >50 yo, male, white, hiatal
        hernia, obesity, nocturnal reflux, tobacco use, first-degree
        relative w/ Barrett’s and/or adenocarcinoma)
    -   Abnormal UGI tract imaging (i.e. luminal abnormalities).
    -   Continued sxs despite adequate PPI therapy

Management

-
-   Lifestyle and dietary modifications in all pts (weight loss; elevate
    HOB; avoid precipitants such as fatty foods, caffeine, alcohol,
    spicy foods, large meals, late night meals)
    -   Mild/intermittent sxs (\<2 episodes/wk) and no erosive
        esophagitis
        
        step-up therapy q4-8 wks until sxs are controlled, then continue
        for at least 8 wks:
    -   Low-dose H2RA prn
        
        standard dose H2RA BID (min 2 wks)
        
        discontinue H2RA and start daily low dose PPI
        
        standard dose PPI
-   Frequent sxs (>2 episodes/wk, and/or severe sxs that impair QOL)
    
    step-down therapy in order to optimize sx relief
    -   Standard-dose PPI daily (8 wks)
        
        low-dose PPI daily
        
        H2RA (if mild/intermittent sxs)
        
        stop if asymptomatic
        -   PPIs should be prescribed at lowest dose and for shortest
            duration appropriate
        -   Taper if taking for >6 months and plan to discontinue

Additional Information

-   Erosive esophagitis and Barrett’s esophagus:
    -   Require maintenance acid suppression with a standard dose PPI
        daily given likelihood of recurrent sxs and complications if
        stopped
-   Recurrent Symptoms (2/3 of pts with nonerosive reflux disease
    relapse when acid suppression is discontinued):
    -   If ≥3 months after discontinuing
        
        repeat 8 week course
    -   If \<3 months of discontinuing
        
        EGD (if not already performed) to r/o other etiologies or
        complications
-   Medications:
    -   Low dose H2RA: famotidine 10mg BID
    -   Standard dose H2RA: famotidine 20mg BID
    -   Low dose PPI: omeprazole 10 mg daily
    -   Standard dose PPI: omeprazole 20 mg daily

Eosinophilic Esophagitis

Background

-   Pt usually with a hx of asthma/allergies/eczema
-   Dysphagia (most commonly to solid foods), food impaction, central
    chest pain, GERD/refractory heartburn, upper abdominal pain

Evaluation

-

-   Diagnostic criteria

-   -   Sxs related to esophageal dysfunction
    -   EGD with >15 eos/hpf on biopsy and exclusion of other causes (no
        longer requires PPI trial as pts who are PPI-responsive do not
        appear to be clinically distinct from those who are
        PPI-nonresponsive)
    -   Exclusion of other causes that may be responsible for or
        contributing to sxs and esophageal eosinophilia
        -   50-60% pts will have elevated serum IgE lvl, peripheral
            eosinophilia can be seen but is generally mild.

Management

-
-   Standard dose PPI for 8 weeks +/- elimination diet
    
    if still symptomatic after 4 weeks, increase PPI to BID
    
    if responsive, continue PPI at lowest dose possible for sx control
-   Alternative treatment is swallowed budesonide or fluticasone
-   Intermittent dilation of strictures to relieve dysphagia, but no
    effect on underlying inflammation
-   Should undergo evaluation by allergist, given strong association
    with allergies
