# Diarrhea

Diarrhea – Claudio Tombazzi

Background

-   \>3 BM/day OR abnormally loose stool
-   Acute (\<2 weeks), persistent (2-4 weeks), or chronic (>4 weeks)
-   95% of acute diarrhea is self-limited & no additional treatment
    needed
-   Most cases of acute diarrhea are due to infections
-   Non-infectious etiologies become more common with increasing
    duration
-   Voluminous watery diarrhea more likely disorder of small bowel
-   Small volume frequent diarrhea more likely disorder of Colon
-   Nocturnal diarrhea suggests an inflammatory or secretory etiology

Acute Diarrhea

-   Watery diarrhea: viral gastroenteritis (norovirus, rotavirus,
    enteric adenovirus), C. diff, C. perfringens, S. Aureus, Bacillus
    cereus, enterotoxigenic E. coli, Cryptosporidium, Listeria,
    Cyclospora, vibrio cholerae (Giardia is typically more chronic),
    Tropheryma whipplei
-   Inflammatory diarrhea: Salmonella, Campylobacter, Shigella, EHEC,
    Yersinia, E histolytica, invasive viruses (CMV, HSV), Non-cholera
    vibrio
-   SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to cause GI symptoms such as diarrhea and
    N/V
    -   Medications (see below)
    -   Any antibiotic can cause C. diff; the longer the treatment, the
        more likely
    -   Most common to cause C. diff:
        Clindamycin >Penicillins/Ceph/Fluoroquinolones

Presentation

-   Evaluate for red flags (BATS are Vulnerable vampires)
    -   B
        loody stools, **A** ntibiotics/Recent hospitalization
    -   T
        oo many stools: >6 unformed stools/day, **S** epsis (Fever)/
        **S** evere abdominal pain
    -   Vulnerables
        (Age >70 yr, immunocompromised, IVDU, IBD, pregnant, travel

Evaluation

-   -   CBC w/ diff, BMP (eval for leukocytosis, AKI, electrolyte
        abnormalities)
    -   C. diff  PCR
    -   CRP/ESR (if inflammatory)
    -   GIPP  (consider for patients with red flag symptoms (see above))
    -   CT A/P if abdominal pain present
    -   CT Enterography if concern for IBD
    -   Blood Cultures (if febrile)

Management

-   Systemic complications (dehydration, AKI, electrolyte
    abnormalities/acidosis)
    -   PO intake (with solute i.e. Gatorade) or IVF if severe/unable to
        tolerate PO
    -   Monitor and replace electrolytes
    -   Downsides of abx: can precipitate **HUS** if 0157:H7, can
        prolong carrier state if salmonella, can precipitate C. diff
    -   Empiric antibiotic therapy ONLY if toxic appearance or high
        concern for progressive illness/decompensation
        -   Ciprofloxacin 500 mg BID or levofloxacin 500 mg daily x 3-5
            days
        -   Azithromycin 500 mg daily x 3 days
        -   Ampicillin + gentamicin used for pregnant women to cover for
            Listeria
-   Symptomatic therapy (Okay to use if C. diff ruled out)
    -   Loperamide 4mg x1, 2mg after each loose stool (maximum 16mg/day)
        for 2 days
    -   Lomotil 5mg every 6 hours until control achieved (can alternate
        with loperamide)
    -   Probiotics may be helpful
-   C. diff positive (see section below)

Approach to Chronic Diarrhea

Watery

-   Secretory
    -   Microscopic Colitis
    -   Bile acid malabsorption
    -   Carcinoid
    -   Crohn’s disease (early ileocolitis)
    -   Gastrinoma
    -   VIPoma
    -   Mastocytosis
    -   Addison’s disease
    -   Medication induced: antibiotics (i.e. Augmentin), caffeine,
        colchicine, NSAIDs, antineoplastics, antiarrhythmics (digoxin),
        metformin, carbamazepine

-   Motility
    -   Hyperthyroidism
    -   Diabetes
    -   Amyloidosis
    -   Systemic Scleroderma
    -   Medications: macrolides, metoclopramide, bisacodyl, senna,
        pyridostigmine
-   Osmotic
    -   Lactose Intolerance
    -   Bile salt diarrhea
    -   Sugar alcohols: Sorbitol, mannitol, xylitol
    -   Medications: citrates, lactulose, magnesium-containing antacids,
        mycophenolate, antibiotics (i.e. ampicillin, clindamycin),
        methyldopa, quinidine, propranolol, hydralazine, procainamide
-   Functional: IBS

Fatty (steatorrhea): ​​​​​​​

-   Malabsorption
    -   Celiac disease
    -   Gastric bypass
    -   Short bowel syndrome
    -   Tropical Sprue
    -   Whipple disease
    -   Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO)
    -   Post-infectious malabsorptive diarrhea
    -   Maldigestion
    -   Pancreatic insufficiency
    -   Hepatobiliary disorders

Inflammatory:

-   Diverticulitis
-   Ischemic colitis
-   Neoplasia
-   Radiation colitis
-   Arsenic poisoning
-   Microscopic colitis
-   Invasive infections: bacterial (tuberculosis, yersinosis), viral
    (CMV, HSV),
-   parasites (amebiasis, strongyloidiasis)

<!-- -->

-   Inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn’s disease, Ulcerative Colitis)

<!-- -->

-   -   Age of onset > 50
    -   Rectal bleeding or melena
    -   Nocturnal pain or diarrhea
    -   Progressive abdominal pain
    -   1 <sup>st</sup> degree relative with IBD or colorectal cancer
        Unexplained weight loss, fever, systemic symptoms

Evaluation

-   -   Labs: CBC w/ diff, CMP, ESR/CRP, TSH, celiac serologies if high
        suspicion (anti-TTG)
    -   Spot fecal elastase Steatorrhea (greasy, malodorous stools that
        float)Colonoscopy indicated if alarm symptoms are present, >50
        yo and hasn’t had one, or \<50 yo and concern for IBD, CMV,
        ischemic colitis or microscopic colitis.
    -   If concern for IBS: Rome IV criteria (abdominal pain 1d/week for
        3 months with 2/3 of the follow: related to defecation, change
        in stool frequency, change in stool form)

Management

-   -   IBS: trial elimination diet/low FODMAP, antidiarrheals
    -   Pancreatic insufficiency: enzyme replacement (Creon), consult
        nutrition for assistance
    -   Celiac: eliminate gluten, will need outpatient nutrition
        follow-up
    -   Bile acid malabsorption: can try cholestyramine (can affect
        absorption of other meds)
