# Acute Pancreatitis

Acute Pancreatitis – Alex Wiles

Background

-   Common causes **:** Gallstones (40%), EtOH (30%), smoking
-   Other causes **:** post-ERCP, pancreatic cancer/obstruction, blunt
    abdominal trauma, hypertriglyceridemia (TG >1000), hypercalcemia,
    drugs (thiazides, protease inhibitors, azathioprine, 6MP), mumps,
    Coxsackie, vasculitis, pregnancy, genetic (PRSS1, SPINK1, CFTR),
    autoimmune (IgG4), scorpion venom
-   Most important intervention during the first 12 – 24 hr and has
    direct effect on mortality
    -   SIRS leads to 3rd spacing and dehydration
-   Several scoring systems:
-   BISAP (BUN >25, Impaired mental status, SIRS, Age>60, Pleural
    effusion)
    -   0 – 2
        
        Mortality \< 2%; 3 - 5
        
        Mortality > 15 %
-   APACHE II (MD Calc, several factors)
    -   Decreasing values = mild attack; increasing values = severe
        attack
    -   0 – 8
        
        Mortality \<4%;  > 8
        
        Mortality 11 – 18 %
-   Ranson’s Criteria (MD Calc, severity at 0 and 48 hours)
    -   \< 3
        
        Mortality 0 – 3 %; <u>\></u> 3
        
        Mortality 11 – 15 %; <u>\></u> 6
        
        Mortality 40 %

Presentation

-   Atlanta criteria requires two of three (PIE)
    -   Pain characteristic of pancreatitis (sharp, epigastric,
        radiating to back)
    -   Imaging characteristic of pancreatitis (US, CT, MRI)
    -   Enzymes (lipase or amylase) >3x ULN (use lipase, much more
        specific)
    -   \*If pain is characteristic and lipase > 3xULN, no need for CT
        A/P
-   Grading Severity:
    -   Mild: no organ failure or systemic complications
    -   Moderate: transient organ failure (\<48 hours)
    -   Severe: persistent organ failure (>48 hours)

Evaluation

-   Lipase, CBC, CMP, lipid panel, lactate, direct bilirubin
-   Obtain RUQ U/S for **all** **pts** , evaluates for gallstones
-   CT A/P w/  IV contrast
    -   Reserved for patients not improving at 48-72 hour to assess for
        complications
    -   If performed at onset, underestimates severity (necrosis takes
        72 hours from onset)

Management

-   Fluids, Fluids, Fluids
    :
-   First 12-24 hrs: LR at 200 to 500 cc/hr, or 5-10 cc/kg / hr (2.5 – 4
    L within first 24 hrs)
-   Follow HCT and BUN as markers for successful fluid resuscitation
    -   Aggressive IVF in first 24 hours reduces both morbidity and
        mortality
    -   Persistent hemoconcentration at 24 hr associated w/ necrotizing
        pancreatitis
-   Pain Control:
    -   Common starting narcotic regimen is oxycodone 10 mg q6H PRN and
        hydromorphone 0.5 mg q3h - q4h for breakthrough (can refer to
        inpatient pain control section)
    -   Consider consult to acute pain service for assistance

-   Nutrition:
    -   NPO but start PO diet as soon as patient can tolerate (even
        within 24 hours)
    -   Clear liquid diet or mechanical soft and advance as tolerated
    -   Low fat diet (Fatty acids  CCK → trypsinogen to trypsin)
    -   If NPO > 72 hours, attempt PO and if fail, place Dobhoff for
        enteral nutrition at latest by day five… outcomes with
        NG/NJ >\>\> TPN

<!-- -->

-   Antibiotics:
    -   Fever, leukocytosis common, not an indication for ABX as the
        necrosis is **sterile**
    -   Infection of the necrosis should be suspected w/ **failure to
        improve 7 days after** onset
        -   Cefepime + Flagyl or carbapenem
    -   EUS or IR guided drain for aspirate: only done if fluid is
        walled-off—at least 4 weeks
    -   Infected pseudocysts or walled-off pancreatic necrosis may
        require prolonged course of ABX and serial imaging

Additional Information

-   If choledocholithiasis suspected
    
    ERCP
-   If the diagnosis is in question
    
    MRCP
-   If biliary sludge but no stones on U/S, still consider
    cholecystectomy (likely microlithiasis)
-   Complications:
    -   ARDS, abdominal compartment syndrome, AKI, DIC
    -   \< 4 weeks after pancreatitis: Peripancreatic fluid collection,
        acute necrotic collection
    -   \> 6 weeks after pancreatitis: Pancreatic pseudocyst, walled-off
        necrosis (WON)
    -   Most fluid collections should be followed over time as acute
        collections can resolve and are unable to be sampled safely with
        EUS
-   Gallstone pancreatitis:
    -   All pts should have cholecystectomy once recovered (recurrence
        is 25-30%)

    -   Performed during initial admission in cases of mild acute
        pancreatitis

    -   -   Consider age or co-morbid illness precludes fitness for
            surgery; consult EGS
