# Lymphoma

Lymphoma - Margaret Wheless

Background

-   Malignancy of lymphoid cells comprising multiple different cancers
    of the immune system depending on the subtype and stage of
    development of cell/tissue involved
-   Characterized by lymphadenopathy & constitutional “B” symptoms:
    -   Fevers, drenching night sweats and weight loss
-   Branch point of diagnosis:
    -   Hodgkin: 10% - superficial, nodal disease with orderly spread
    -   Non
        -Hodgkin: 90% - diffuse, nodal and extranodal disease with
        noncontiguous spread

Evaluation

-   B symptoms; pruritus (10-15% of pt with HL); history of radiation
-   Lymphadenopathy: painless, firm, fixed, >1cm
-   Exam: head & neck, tonsils, axilla, testes, liver, spleen
-   CBC, CMP, LDH, Uric Acid
-   HBV, HCV,  HIV, EBV, Quant gold, Treponemal Ab, ANA
-   Imaging: CXR
    
    most will eventually need PET-CT; MRI brain if neuro symptoms
-   Diagnosis requires tissue
    -   Excisional
        Lymph node biopsy (surg onc. Consult)
    -   Core biopsy (CT guided procedure consult)
-   Ann Arbor Staging System: I. 1 LN region
    -   II\. >2 LN regions, same side of diaphragm
    -   III\. LN regions on both sides of diaphragm
    -   IV\. Dissem dz w/ 1+ extralymphatic organ

Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL)

Background

-   65 y/o, M>F, 85-90% B-cell
-   Associated with immunodeficiency (HIV, post-transplant), autoimmune
    disease (both the disease and immunosuppression), infection (EBV,
    HTLV-1, H pylori,  HCV, Borrelia, C
-   psittacosis, Coxiella)
-   Stratify into:
    -   Good prognosis
        :
        waxing/waning LAD, cytopenias, hepatomegaly or splenomegaly
    -   Poor
        prognosis
        : Aggressive presentation: fever, night sweats, weight loss, TLS

Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL)

Background

-   Bimodal Distritbution: 15-35 y/o and >50; M>F
-   CD15+, CD30+ (Reed Sternberg cells “owl eyes”)
-   Associated with EBV in immunocompromised pt
-   4 classical types
    -   Nodular sclerosing (60-80%): young adult, F>M, low stage,
        mediastinal LAD, collagen bands
    -   Lymphocyte rich (5%): best prog
    -   Lymphocyte depleted (\<1%): worst prognosis, older, M>F,
        disseminated, HIV+, diffuse positive and RS cells
    -   Mixed (15-30%): older, M>F, intermediate prognosis
-   1 nonclassical (5%): nodular lymphocyte predominant, peripheral LN

Presentation

-   Lymphadenopathy (usually contiguous), generalized pruritus,
    Incidental mediastinal mass
-   B-Symptoms: fevers, night sweats, weight loss

Evaluation

-   IPS negative prognostic calculator: albumin \<4, hemoglobin \<10.5,
    male, stage IV by Ann Arbor, age>45, WBC count> 15K, lymphocyte \<8%

Management

-   Stage I-II: ABVD (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine)
    ± RT
-   Stages III-IV: ABVD x6 or escalated BEACOPP (bleo, etop, doxo,
    cyclophos, vinc, procarbazine, prednisone)

Additional Information

-   Pts will need TTE prior to chemo given the use of anthracycline
-   Increased risk of secondary cancers (\~25% of pt with 40% increased
    risk over next 40 years)
