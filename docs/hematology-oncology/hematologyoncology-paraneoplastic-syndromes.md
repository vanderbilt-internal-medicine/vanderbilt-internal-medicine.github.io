<span id="Paraneoplastic"></span>

Hypercalcemia of malignancy

Background

-   Caused
    by PTHrP production, osteolytic lesions, and/or rarely exogenous Vit
    D
-   PTHrP
    
    Breast cancer, NSCLC (squamous)
-   Osteolysis
    
    Multiple Myeloma, Breast Cancer;
-   Exogenous Vit D
    
    Lymphoma

Evaluation

-   Correct \[Ca <sup>+2</sup> \] for hypoalbuminemia: add 0.8 x (4.0 –
    albumin)
-   Send basic hyperCa <sup>+2</sup> work-up – PTH, Vit D, etc (see
    hypercalcemia section)
-   PTHrP is called “Parathyroid Hormone-related Peptide-ARUP” in Epic

Management

-   First-line: IVF without calcium such as Normosol
    
    goal urinary output of 150-200 mL/hr
    -   Strict I/Os; Cautious IV fluids if pt w/cardiac or renal
        dysfunction
    -   Add Furosemide if hypervolemic (do not empirically start)
-   Second-line: Zoledronic acid 4mg IV (takes 24-48 hours to see
    effect)
-   AMS or severe hypercalcemia (>14mg/dL): calcitonin 4 IU/kg (req.
    attending approval)
-   Monitor creatinine, calcium and potassium
-   Begin treatment for underlying malignancy ASAP

SIADH

Background

-   Euvolemic hypotonic hyponatremia with urine sodium >20 and typically
    urine Osm >100
-   Associated with: SCLC (most common), head/neck cancers, breast
    cancer
-   See "Nephrology" for additional information

Management

-   Free water restriction to 800mL/day
-   Refractory: salt supplementation (e.g. salt tabs) +/- loop diuretic

Carcinoid Syndrome

Background

-   Episodic
    flushing, diarrhea, wheezing/SOB due to secretion of histamine &
    serotonin
-   Most common: Neuroendocrine tumors – GI (often with mets to liver
    and lung)

Evaluation

-   Urine: UR 5-HIAA (ARUP)
-   Imaging to identify tumor(s) (CT chest/abdomen/pelvis)

Management

-   Short-term treatment: subQ or IV octreotide (see UpToDate for
    dosing)
-   Antidiarrheals (Imodium, Lomotil, etc.) to slow transit
-   Long-term treatment: depot (IM) forms of octreotide and lanreotide

Autoimmune encephalitis, encephalomyelitis, and myelitis

Background

-   Encephalopathy (limbic or brainstem), +/- myelitis (limb ataxia,
    sensory deficits)
-   Associated with small cell lung cancer and checkpoint inhibitor
    therapy

Evaluation

-   LP: make sure to order CSF oligoclonal bands & CSF IgG index
-   “Paraneoplastic AutoAb Eval-MAYO” (add "CSF" to the front of the
    order name if for LP)
-   NMDA-R can be ordered as a standalone test
-   CT head
-   EEG if concern for subclinical seizures

Management:

Consult Neurology, for possible immunosuppressive therapy (steroids,
IVIG)

Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS)

Background

-   Muscle
    weakness due to autoantibody against calcium channels resulting in
    ↓
    ACh release
-   Associated
    with SCLC (most common) & lymphoma

Presentation: Proximal muscle weakness, diminished DTRs

Evaluation

-   Nerve conduction studies: EMG w/ NCV
-   Serum “Paraneoplastic AutoAb Eval-MAYO”

Management:

Consult Neurology
