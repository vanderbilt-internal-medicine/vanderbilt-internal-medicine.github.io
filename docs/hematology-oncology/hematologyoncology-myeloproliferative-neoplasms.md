# Myeloproliferative Neoplasms

Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (MPNs)—Christina Snider

Background

-   MPNs = chronic myeloid disorders caused by abnormal proliferation of
    mature bone marrow cell lineages (granulocytes, erythrocytes, or
    megakaryocytes)
-   MPNs differ from myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)—cells in MPNs are
    normally developed (i.e. not dysplastic)
-   Four “classic” MPNs: polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia,
    primary myelofibrosis and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)

Polycythemia Vera (PV)

-   Polycythemia is a general term: Men = Hb/Hct > 16.5/49%;  Women =
    Hb/Hct > 16/48%
-   Relative polycythemia
    = Concentrated H/H due to decreased plasma volume
    -   Diuretic use, vomiting, diarrhea;  H/H should normalize with
        fluid resuscitation
-   Absolute polycythemia
    = Increased RBC mass
    -   Primary
        polycythemia: 2/2 Inherited/acquired mutation in RBC progenitor
    -   Secondary polycythemia: Increase in RBC mass due to elevated
        serum EPO
        -   Hypoxia/cardiopulmonary associated (chronic pulmonary
            disease, R-to-L cardiac shunts, sleep apnea, obesity
            hypoventilation syndrome, chronic carbon monoxide poisoning,
            including heavy smoking)
        -   Kidney associated causes (following renal transplant, renal
            artery stenosis, hydronephrosis)
        -   Autonomous EPO production from an EPO-producing tumors
            (rare)
        -   Steroid Use
-   Epidemiology: Median age of diagnosis is 60 years; 25% cases present
    at age \<50 years.
-   \>95% PV pts have *JAK2* V617F mutation, but *JAK2* V617F mutation
    is not specific to PV and can be seen in other MPNs

Presentation

-   Incidentally elevated H/H
-   Splenomegaly, generalized pruritus (post-warm bath/shower), unusual
    thrombosis
-   Erythromelalgia: intermittent occurrence of red, hot, painful
    extremities

Evaluation

-   CBC with differential and peripheral smear
-   EPO level
-   Rule out secondary causes: Sleep Study, Carboxyhemoglobin, steroids
-   Peripheral blood screen for *JAK2* V617F mutation

Management

-   PV treatment aims to prevent thrombosis and bleeding events.
-   Phlebotomy: maintain Hct \<45% (One unit 500 mL decreases Hct by 3%)
-   ASA 81 mg for thrombosis prevention and symptom control
-   Hydroxyurea: indicated for high-risk patients (>60 years old or with
    history of thrombosis)
-   Interferon-alfa, busulfan, or ruxolitinib: indicated in select
    high-risk patients

Essential thrombocythemia (ET)

Background

-   Clonal stem cell disorder w/ increased platelet counts (>450k/uL)
-   Risks of thrombosis and hemorrhage
-   Median age of diagnosis: 60 years; Twice as common in females.

Presentation

-   Incidental thrombocytosis on CBC
-   Splenomegaly, unusual thrombosis, and erythromelalgia

Evaluation

-   Screen for conditions that cause reactive thrombocytosis: Chronic
    inflammatory diseases, infections, bleeding/hemolysis, iron
    deficiency, post splenectomy
-   CBC with smear (platelet anisocytosis) ranging from very small to
    giant platelets
-   CMP, LDH, Uric Acid, iron studies
-   BCR ABL1 testing may be sent to exclude CML
-   Bone marrow biopsy with staining, cytogenetics, and molecular
    testing for JAK2 mutations

Management

-   Avoid ASA 81 in patients with platelet counts >1 million/uL microL
    complicated by acquired von Willebrand syndrome due to increased
    risk of bleeding

Primary Myelofibrosis (PMF)

Background

-   Clonal proliferation of myeloid cells with variable morphologic
    maturity resulting in reactive marrow fibrosis and extramedullary
    hematopoiesis
-   Least favorable prognosis out of MPN

Presentation

-   Fatigue, weight loss, low grade fever, bone pain, and night sweats
-   Marked splenomegaly +/-hepatomegaly (due to extramedullary
    hematopoiesis)

Evaluation

-   smear: teardrop shaped RBCs (dacrocytes)
-   Bone marrow biopsy: “dry tap” due to extensive reticulin and/or
    collagen fibrosis
-   mutually exclusive mutations in JAK2, MPL, or CALR

Management

-   Low risk patients: Observe if asymptomatic
-   Cure by allogenic HCT transplantation in young, high risk patients
-   Complex treatment options, consult Hematology
-   Treatment of anemias include transfusion support
-   Surgical splenectomy if abdominal pain or transfusion dependent
    anemia

Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML)

Background

-   Definition: MPN overproduction of myeloid stem cells that can
    differentiate
-   Chronic phase: 85% of pts
    -   Fatigue, weight loss, bleeding
    -   Abdominal fullness and early satiety due to splenomegaly
    -   WBC on CBC is typically >100k, and smear shows neutrophilic
        cells in all stages of maturation with \<2% blasts
-   Accelerated phase: Refractory leukocytosis, 10-19% blasts in
    peripheral blood or bone marrow, worsening peripheral basophilia,
    thrombocytopenia
-   Blast phase = acute leukemia. >20% blasts in peripheral blood or
    bone marrow, extramedullary proliferation of blasts

Evaluation

-   Typical findings in blood and bone marrow and confirmation of
    Philadelphia chromosome ( *BCR-ABL1* fusion gene) via conventional
    cytogenetics, FISH, or rt-PCR

Management

-   Hydroxyurea can be used to reduce WBC while awaiting confirmation
-   Oral tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIS): Imatinib, dasatinib,
    nilotinib, and ponatinib
-   Allogenic hematopoietic cell transplantation: Curative option for
    pts in accelerated and blast phase, as well as young pts w/chronic
    phase CML who do not respond to TKI therapy
