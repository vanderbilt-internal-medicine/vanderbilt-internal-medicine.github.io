# DVTs

Deep Vein Thromboses – Trey Richardson

-   Background:
    Incidence of 1-2 per 1,000 people per year
-   Depending on the study and population, associated with a 15%
    mortality rate
-   70% of patients with PE have a detectable DVT
-   List of deep veins
    -   Distal Lower Ext.: Posterior tibial, Anterior tibial, Peroneal,
        Gastrocnemius, Soleus veins
    -   Proximal Lower Ext.: External, Internal, and Common iliac;
        Common, superficial, and deep femoral veins; Popliteal vein
    -   Upper extremity: Radial, ulnar, brachial, axillary, and
        subclavian veins
-   Risk Factors for Provoked DVT/PE – Known Event
    -   Major risk factors: major surgery >30 minutes, hospitalization >
        3 days, C-section
    -   Minor Risk Factors: Surgery \<30 minutes, Hospitalization \<3
        days, pregnancy, estrogen therapy, reduced mobility >3 days,
        infection in past 3 months
-   Persistent risk factors: Malignancy (active), inflammatory bowel
    disease, hereditary thrombophilia, CHF
-   Active cancer (LR of 2.6) recent trauma/surgery or immobilization
    (LR of 1.6 each) are the clinical scenarios when suspicion should be
    the highest

Presentation

-   Asymmetric calf swelling of > 2cm sensitivity/specificity for DVT of
    60-70% and a likelihood ratio (LR) of 2.1

Evaluation

-   Wells’ Criteria for DVT can help guide diagnostic testing
    -   If a patient has a low pre-test probability, a negative D-dimer
        can rule out DVT
    -   In a high pre-test probability patient a negative D-dimer is
        less helpful
-   Whole-leg (common femoral to deep calf veins) ultrasounds with
    doppler

Management

-   Prophylaxis
    -   Padua score: Score > 4 high risk; A score \<4 low risk for
        thrombosis
-   Choice of anticoagulation for treatment: (See anticoagulation
    section)
-   Duration of treatment
    -   Provoked: 3-6 mos or until provoking factor (trauma, surgery,
        malignancy) is removed
        -   Pts w/high risk cancers require more tailored therapy since
            the provoking factor is the malignancy itself. GI
            malignancies tend to be the highest risk.
    -   Unprovoked: Requires life-long anticoagulation along with
        assistance from hematology
    -   Recurrent: Even if they have all ben provoked, requires
        life-long treatment
        -   Close follow-up with hematology
    -   Distal:  Limited data, but can treat for 3 months or monitor for
        resolution with serial US
    -   Upper Extremity: Treat as DVT for at least 3 months
    -   Superficial vein : treat for 3 mo, if within 2 cm of junction w/
        deep vein (high risk of propagation)

Additional Information

-   Decision to screen for hyper-coagulable disorders based on age
    (\<45), history of prior DVTs, family hx of clotting disorders, and
    hx of thrombi in atypical locations (arterial)
-   If no contraindications (acute bleeding, planned procedure,
    thrombocytopenia etc.) then most patients will tolerate prophylaxis
-   Follow up ultrasound
    -   Limited data regarding utility of follow up ultrasound but may
        be warranted if patient at high risk for post-thrombotic
        complications or has persistent symptoms
-   What about IVC filters?
    -   In patients at high risk for DVT and in whom anti-coagulation is
        contraindicated (thrombocytopenia, recent intra-cranial bleed,
        recent GI bleed) placement of a retrievable IVC filter should be
        discussed with IR
