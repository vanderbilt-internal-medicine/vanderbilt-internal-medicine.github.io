# Bone Marrow Transplant

## Background
-	Donor selection
    -	Autologous: self, no matching required (no GVHD risk, but also no graft-vs-tumor effect)
    -	Allogeneic: non-self, matching based on HLA (more matched = less GVHD risk)
        -	Matched-related donor (MRD): fully matched sibling
        -	Matched-unrelated donor (MUD): from NMDP database
        -	Haploidentical: half matched sibling or parent
-	Source of stem cells:
    -	Peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) vs. bone marrow-derived cells vs umbilical cord
-	Conditioning regimens:
    -	Myeloablative vs. reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC)
-	GVHD prophylaxis (for allo-SCT)
    -	Regimen varies: can include tacrolimus, MMF, MTX, or thymo and alemtuzumab during conditioning

## Complications/Adverse Effects:
-	Infectious
    -	Neutropenic fever, neutropenic enterocolitis (typhlitis)
    -	Bacterial infections
    -	Viral infections
        -	CMV: check weekly PCR levels post-allo-SCT
            -	All CMV+ recipients are treated with letermovir prophylactically regardless of donor status
        -	EBV: check weekly PCR levels post allo-SCT. If EBV VL >1000 on two occasions, can treat with pre-emptive rituximab to reduce the risk of PTLD
    -	Invasive fungal infections (e.g. aspergillus, candida)
-	Non-infectious
    -	Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, mucositis, cytopenias
    -	Hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD)/sinusoidal obstructive syndrome (SOS)
        -	Pathophysiology: sinusoidal endothelial cell damage from conditioning chemo -> post-sinusoidal portal HTN -> cytokine release -> multiorgan failure and death
        -	Diagnosis:  total bili >2, hepatomegaly/RUQ pain, weight gain > 2-5%
        -	Evaluation: RUQ U/S with doppler
        -	Treatment: Per heme attending; generally supportive, consider defibrotide
    -	Graft failure:
        -	Primary: persistent neutropenia without engraftment
        -	Secondary: delayed pancytopenia 2/2 immune phenomena or infection after engraftment
    -	Engraftment syndrome:
        -	Pathophysiology: PMN recovery -> cytokine storm -> vascular leak
        -	Symptoms: fever, tachycardia, hypotension, SOB, pulmonary edema, rash, weight gain, bone pain, confusion
        -	Diagnosis: clinical
        -	Treatment: high-dose IV steroids
    -	Idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS)
        -	Umbrella term that also includes peri-engraftment respiratory distress syndrome (PERDS) and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH)
        -	Pathophysiology: Lung injury from conditioning -> cytokines -> recruitment of alloreactive T cells -> progressive lung injury resembling ARDS
        -	Diagnosis: multi-lobar airspace opacities and hypoxia in absence of infection
        -	Evaluation: imaging, bronchoscopy with BAL
        -	Management: Prednisone 1-2 mg/kg or pulse 1g/d x3 days; etanercept 2nd line
    -	Acute GVHD
        -	Only in allogenic; increased risk with more HLA mismatch
        -	Pathophysiology: donor T cells attack recipient (Th1-mediated)
        -	Symptoms: skin rash, cholestatic liver injury, diarrhea
        -	Treatment: IV steroids (methylprednisolone 1-2mg/kg x 5d)
            -	If refractory: mycophenolate, etanercept, ruxolitinib, antithymocyte globulin
     -	Chronic GVHD (typically after T+100)
         -	Can involve all organs but typically see a scleroderma-like picture (xerophthalmia, xerostomia dysphagia, arthritis, skin changes, malar rash, obliterative bronchiolitis, cholestatic liver injury, cytopenias)
         -	Treatment: Steroids (also photophoresis for skin), Consider trials of ruxolitinib, ibrutinib, rituximab if refractor,
       -	Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD)
            -	Pathophysiology: B-cell proliferative disease typically from latent EBV
            -	Symptoms: fever, weight loss, fatigue, lymphadenopathy, extra-nodal masses, ↑ EBV PCR
