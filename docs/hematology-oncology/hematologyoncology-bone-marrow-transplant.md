Bone Marrow Transplant – Michael LaPelusa

Background

-   Donor selection
    -   Autologous: self, no matching required
    -   Allogeneic: non-self, matching based on HLA (more matching ->
        less GVHD risk)
        -   Matched-related donor (MRD): fully matched sibling
        -   Matched-unrelated donor (MUD): From NMDP database
        -   Haploidentical: Half matched sibling or parent
-   Source of stem cells:
    -   Peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) vs bone marrow-derived cells
        vs umbilical cord
    -   Timeline for transplant:T -14 d: cell mobilization and
        collection (G-CSF used to help mobilize stem cells)
    -   T -8 d to T-3d: conditioning regimen, initiation of GVHD ppx,
        TLS ppx and sinusoidal obstruction syndrome ppx
    -   T = 0 d: transplant
    -   T +7 d to T +30 d: engraftment

Complications/Adverse Effects:

-   Infectious
    : Neutropenic fever, typhlitis, GNR, HSV, respiratory/enteral
    viruses (adenovirus, RSV, parainfluenza), Aspergillus, Candida
-   Non
    -infectious
    -   Nausea, vomiting, mucositis
    -   Cytopenia’s: Transfuse as needed (plt >10, hematocrit >21)
    -   Hepatic
        veno-occlusive disease/sinusoidal obstructive syndrome:
        -   2/2 cytotoxic venule damage from chemo resulting in thrombi
            formation
        -   Diagnosis: T Bili >2, hepatomegaly/RUQ pain, weight gain >
            2-5%
        -   Evaluation: RUQ US with doppler
        -   Treatment: Per heme attending; Consider defibrotide
    -   Graft failure – primary (persistent neutropenia without
        engraftment) or secondary (delayed pancytopenia 2/2 immune
        phenomena or infection after engraftment)
    -   Engraftment
        syndrome:
        -   Pathophys: PMN recovery -> cytokine storm -> vascular leak
        -   Symptoms: fever, tachycardia, hypotension, SOB, pulmonary
            edema, rash, weight gain, bone pain, confusion
        -   Diagnosis: clinical; Workup specific symptoms
        -   Treatment: high-dose IV steroids
    -   Acute GVHD:
        -   Only in allogenic; Increased risk with more HLA mismatch
        -   Pathophys: donor T cells attack recipient (Th1-mediated)
        -   Symptoms: skin rash, cholestatic liver injury, diarrhea
        -   Treatment: IV steroids (methylprednisolone 1-2mg/kg x 5d)
            -   If refractory: mycophenolate, etanercept, ruxolitinib,
                antithymocyte globulin
    -   Chronic GVHD (typically after T+100d s/p allo)
        -   Can involve all organs but typically see a scleroderma-like
            picture (xerophthalmia, xerostomia dysphagia, arthritis,
            skin changes, malar rash, obliterative bronchiolitis,
            cholestatic liver injury, cytopenia’s)
        -   Treatment: steroids (also photophoresis for skin), consider
            trials of ruxolitinib, ibrutinib, rituximab if refractory
    -   PTLD
