# DIC

Disseminated <span id="DIC"></span> Intravascular Coagulation (DIC) -
Eric Singhi

Background

-   Concurrent activation of the coagulation pathway and fibrinolytic
    pathway
-   Widespread endothelial injury + exposure to circulating
    procoagulants
    
    activation of coagulation cascade
    
    thrombin production in small and medium-sized vessels
-   Consumption of platelets, fibrin, and coagulation factors ->
    fibrinolysis -> end organ damage and hemolysis
-   Etiologies:
    -   Infection/Sepsis, Liver disease, Pancreatitis, Trauma
    -   Malignancies: mucin-secreting pancreatic/gastric adenocarcinoma,
        brain tumors, prostate cancer, all acute leukemias, acute
        promyelocytic leukemia
    -   Obstetric complications (i.e. preeclampsia/eclampsia, placental
        abruption)
    -   Acute hemolytic transfusion reaction (i.e. ABO incompatible
        transfusion)

Evaluation

-   Exam:  petechiae, bleeding (mucosal, IV site, surgical wound site,
    hematuria), ecchymoses, thrombosis (i.e. cold, pulseless
    extremities)
-   CBC,  PT/INR, aPTT, Fibrinogen, D-Dimer, Peripheral Blood Smear
-   “DIC labs” = q6h fibrinogen, PT/INR, aPTT (space out when lower
    risk)
-   Findings suggestive of DIC: thrombocytopenia, prolonged aPTT and
    PT/INR, hypofibrinogenemia, elevated D-dimer, fibrin degradation
    products, schistocytes

Management

-   Treat the underlying cause!
-   Hemodynamic support (i.e. hypotension): Intravenous fluid
    resuscitation
-   Vitamin K for INR > 1.7 or bleeding
-   If bleeding consider FFP, Vitamin K to correct coagulopathy
-   Hypofibrinogenemia treatment: Cryoprecipitate 5-10 units if
    fibrinogen \< 100
-   Thrombocytopenia treatment: plt transfusion as normally indicated
-   DVT ppx if not bleeding and plt > 50
-   VTE: anticoagulation if plt > 50 and no massive bleeding
