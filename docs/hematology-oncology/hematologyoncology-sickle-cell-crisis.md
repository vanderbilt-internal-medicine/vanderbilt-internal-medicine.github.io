# Sickle Cell Crisis

S <span id="Sickle_cell"></span> ickle Cell Crisis – Michael J. Neuss

Background

-   Present with severe pain in bone, joints, chest, abdomen
-   Causes: (
    HIDISC) **H** ypoxia, **I** schemia, **D** ehydration, **I**
    nfection, **S** tress, **C** old
-   Cant Miss:
    -   Acute
        chest: hypoxia + fever + chest pain + new infiltrate on CXR
    -   PE (ACS less likely in these patients); avascular necrosis of
        hip, priapism, stroke

Evaluation

-   Labs: LDH (high), Hgb/Hct (low; check vs baseline), retic, smear,
    WBC
-   If febrile: UA + Blood cultures
-   Send Hgb S level, and compare to baseline w/ other hospital
    admissions
-   Imaging: CXR, MRI for hip pain, Abdominal U/S or CT abdomen
-   Maintain active type and *cross* given probability of antibodies

Management

General:

-   Look for a care coordination yellow note in the Summary Tab
    -   Heme clinic will have specific management preferences for
        individual patients
-   Maintain hydration, IVF at 150-200 cc/hr (if no contraindication)
-   Oxygen:
    goal sat \~95% (higher O2 goal will help to prevent further
    sickling!)
-   Continue folic acid 1 mg qDay
-   Continue hydroxyurea if uncomplicated pain crisis
    -   Hold if counts suppressed or concern for infection

<!-- -->

-   If in the MICU: consider discussion for plasma exchange (if Hgb SS
    or SC or S-Thal)
-   Transfuse: Simple transfusion if Hgb lower than baseline and/or
    complications
    -   Avoid transfusions when able, given risk of antibody formation

Pain:

-   Will
    generally require opiates, likely initiation of PCA
-   All
    SS patients should have **pain plans** ; inpatient pain plans are in
    the **problem list under sickle cell disease** or in the **care
    coordination** section of Epic
-   Outpatient
    plans (to which you will transition pts back prior to discharge) are
    not standardized in location, but can be under Media (with a pain
    contract) or found in notes

Acute

chest:

-   Consult Hematology at time of admission
-   D5 1/2 NS @ 150-250 cc/hr
-   Transfuse hgb to >10
-   PCA w/ dilaudid
-   Abx for CAP (vs HAP if risk factors) ± bronchodilators
