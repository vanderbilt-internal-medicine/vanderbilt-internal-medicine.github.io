# Neutropenia and Neutropenic Fever

Neutropenia & Neutropenic Fever – Jennifer Marvin-Peek

Background

-   Neutrope
    nia: absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \< 1500
    -   Severe neutropenia: absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \<500 \[Use
        manual count if available\]
    -   Typically
        requires immediate evaluation and often hospitalization
    -   \>500 is threshold for allowing pt’s to return home after
        chemo-induced neutropenia

Management

-   ANC \<500
    -   Check all lines/IVs for erythema and induration daily
    -   Check mouth for mucositis, mouth care after meals and before bed
    -   Assess for Neutropenic Fever & Complications – see below
    -   Evaluate for indications for prophylaxis – see below
    -   Provide Neutropenic Precautions:
        -   Neutropenic
            diet: low microbial diet
        -   Idea
            is to prevent food-borne illness, however has not been shown
            to decrease infection risk in meta-analyses
        -   No raw, or undercooked foods
        -   No deli meats, seafood, salad bars, unpasteurized products
            or raw sprouts
        -   No digital rectal exams or enemas/suppositories (risk of
            bacterial translocation)

Neutropenic Fever

-   ANC \<500 and T> 100.4 °F or 38.0 °C
-   Neutropenic pts are unable to mount an adequate immune response and
    can become critically ill very quickly
-   Do not wait for a temp re-check, you need to start antibiotics
    immediately

Evaluation

-   Chest X-ray
-   Two sets of blood cultures (one from PICC/port if present)
-   Urinalysis AND urine culture (not the reflex order set)
-   If diarrhea, get C. diff PCR
-   If abdominal pain, get CT A/P with IV contrast

Management

-   Empirically treat with Cefepime
-   Indications for Vancomycin:
    -   Hemodynamically unstable
    -   Severe mucositis
    -   Focal consolidation on CXR
    -   Erythema/induration around line
    -   Concern for skin/soft tissue infection
    -   GPCs in blood
    -   Fever continues >24h on cefepime
-   Additional Coverage:
    -   If abdominal pain/diarrhea: Flagyl 500mg q8h
    -   Concern for C-diff: PO Vancomycin 125mg q6h
    -   Still fevering on Cefepime at 72 hrs (differs by attending)
        
        Meropenem
-   Fungal coverage: Consider if risk factors (TPN) or persistent fevers
    (>72hrs)
    -   Micafungin 100 mg IV daily or Voriconazole 200mg PO BID

Neutropenic Complications

Mucositis

-   Can
    range from mouth soreness to severe erosions preventing
    eating/drinking
-   Can
    become secondarily infected with Candida, HSV
    -   Management
        :
        -   Routine oral care with a soft toothbrush to remove plaque
        -   Oral rinses with saline and/or sodium bicarbonate
        -   Magic mouthwash for symptomatic relief (or viscous lidocaine
            at the VA)
        -   Typically recovers quickly when ANC > 500

Neutropenic

enterocolitis (Typhlitis)

-   Life
    -threatening bacterial translocation due to breakdown of gut-mucosal
    barrier
-   Presentation
    :
    Abdominal pain + fever
    -   +/- abdominal distension, nausea, vomiting, watery and/or bloody
        diarrhea
-   Diagnosis
    :
    CT
    A/P with contrast, consider C. diff PCR if diarrhea
-   Treatment
    :
    -   Cefepime/Flagyl OR Zosyn
    -   If no perforation/abscess on CT scan, typically continue until
        14 days after ANC recovers >500 and abdominal pain resolves
    -   Can change to cipro/flagyl once ANC >500
    -   If perforation/abscess: will need imaging to confirm resolution,
        and longer duration of abx

Neutropenic Prophylaxis

-   Used
    if ANC is expected to be \< 500 for > 7 days

Filgrastim (G-CSF – Neupogen/Zarxio)

-   Induces bone marrow production of Neutrophils
-   Can be given for chemo-induced neutropenia in non-AML malignancies
-   Sometimes given in AML in certain regimens like CLAG-M
-   Dose: either 300mcg or 480mcg (rounded from 5 mcg/kg/day)
-   Common side effects: fatigue, nausea
-   PEG-filgrastim (Neulasta): long-acting version that is only given as
    an outpatient
