# Refractory Hypoxemia

Amelia Muhs

---

## Background
-	Inadequate arterial oxygenation despite high levels of inspired O2 or the development of barotrauma in mechanically ventilated pts
-	Generally start to consider the interventions below if needing FiO2 >80%
-	Differential:
    -	Worsening underlying primary process (e.g. progressive ARDS)
    -	PE
    -	Pneumothorax
    -	Fluid overload
    -	Ventilator-associated Pneumonia
    -	New ARDS

## Evaluation:
-	Always get CXR STAT if pt has new or worsening O2 requirement
-	ABG 
-	Can use POCUS to check for lung sliding (pneumothorax) or RV enlargement/septal bowing/McConnell’s sign (RV strain in PE)

## Initial management
-	Remember – if at any point the pt is rapidly decompensating, you can always disconnect them from the vent and bag them until they recover/while calling for help
-	Early consideration of ECMO consult in appropriate pts (discuss with MICU fellow)
-	Optimize fluid status -> consider diuresis/dialysis if not making urine
-	Consider higher PEEP strategy
    -	Increased PEEP -> higher mean airway pressure, generally improves oxygenation especially with diffuse pulmonary pathologies
        -	Exceptions may include certain focal/shunt pathologies (e.g. dense lobar PNA)
        -	Worsening oxygenation may occur with overdistension of alveoli -> increase dead space ventilation; generally determined empirically at the bedside
    -	Titrate up slowly; generally do not exceed PEEP 18
        -	Limited by high plateau pressures/barotrauma, overdistension/dead space ventilation, decreased preload/venous return
    -	ARDSnet FiO2/PEEP Tables: At VUMC we typically use the Lower PEEP table

### Lower PEEP/higher FiO₂

| **FiO₂** | 0.3 | 0.4 | 0.4 | 0.5 | 0.5 | 0.6 |
|----------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| **PEEP** | 5   | 5   | 8   | 8   | 10  | 10  |

| **FiO₂** | 0.7 | 0.7 | 0.7 | 0.8 | 0.9 | 0.9 |
|----------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| **PEEP** | 10  | 12  | 14  | 14  | 14  | 16  |

| **FiO₂** | 0.9 | 1.0 |
|----------|-----|-----|
| **PEEP** | 18  | 18-24  |

### Higher PEEP/lower FiO₂

| **FiO₂** | 0.3 | 0.3 | 0.3 | 0.3 | 0.3 |
|----------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|

- Other recruitment maneuvers
    - Reposition pt – can try elevating HOB or positioning so “good lung” is down
    - If concern for mucus plug, consider need for bronch
    - If concern for significant atelectasis can try recruitment maneuvers with the vent including sustained inflation (setting expiratory pressure to ~30 for ~30 seconds) and PEEP titration (setting PEEP to 20-25 and decreasing by 2cm at a time) – call the fellow before attempting 

## Management Algorithm for refractory hypoxemia:
-	 Inhaled vasodilators: Distribute preferentially to well-ventilated alveoli -> local vasodilation -> improved V/Q matching
     -	 VUMC formulary preference: inhaled epoprostenol (aka Flolan)
     -	 Alternatives: inhaled milrinone, inhaled nitric oxide
     -	 Data suggest improved PaO2/FiO2; large RCT without evidence for mortality benefit
-	Deep sedation (RASS -4 or -5)
    -	Promotes ventilator synchrony
-	Neuromuscular blockade (paralysis) – call your fellow before doing this
    -	Rationale: maximal vent synchrony (eliminates residual chest wall/diaphragm tone)
    -	Pt MUST be RASS -5 (need analgesia + sedation)
    -	Trial one time IV push of vecuronium 0.1 mg/kg
    -	If improved vent synchrony/oxygenation, consider cisatracurium (Nimbex) drip
    -	Data are mixed  ACURASYS 2010 (improved 90-day mortality but underpowered likely overestimating benefit); ROSE 2019 (no difference in 90-day mortality)
-	Prone positioning (Need attending approval)
    -	Pts with moderate to severe ARDS (PaO2/FiO2 ratio < 150)
    -	At VUMC, we use regular ICU beds and manually flip pts; cycle prone 16h/supine 8h
    -	When proning or supining a pt, always have a provider who can intubate in the room in case unplanned extubation occurs
    -	Considerations: need a team of people to reposition, high risk of ET tube malposition, difficult to access lines/perform procedures, high risk of pressure injuries
    -	Data: PROSEVA 2013 -> proning improved 28-day mortality; study c/b imbalances between groups
-	Alternative ventilator modes (usually PC or APRV/BiLevel/BiVent)
    -	APRV/BiVent should be avoided in people with bad obstructive lung dx, hemodynamic instability, refractory hypercarbia
-	Venovenous (V-V) ECMO
    -	Indications for hypoxemia:
        -	PaO2/FiO2 < 50 with FiO2 >80% for >3h OR
        -	PaO2/FiO2 < 80 with FiO2 >80% for >6h AND
        -	Mechanical ventilation ≤ 1 week
    -	Absolute Contraindications:
        -	Poor short-term prognosis (e.g. metastatic cancer)
        -	Irreversible, devastating neurologic pathology
        -	Chronic respiratory insufficiency without the possibility for transplant
    -	Can calculate RESP score -> predicts in-hospital survival with ECMO
    -	CONSULT EARLY if a pt may be a candidate; allows ECMO team to assist with evaluation
    -	Data:
        -	CESAR 2009: improved 6-month survival without severe disability
        -	EOLIA 2018: no mortality benefit but 28% crossover from control to ECMO arm dilutes potential effects
