| ABCDEF (A2F) Bundle – Kaele Leonard |

Background

-   Post-Intensive Care Syndrome (PICS): complex constellation of
    cognitive, physical, and psychological impairments that impact most
    survivors of critical illness, leading to disability, frailty, and
    poor quality of life
    -   Predicted by (1) duration of immobility and (2) delirium; very
        common in ICU pts
    -   Both are reduced by >80% compliance with ABCDEF (A2F) Bundle
        concepts
-   ABCDEF (A2F) Bundle: Interprofessional, evidence-based safety bundle
    of care principles to help reduce LOS, mortality, bounce-backs, and
    the duration of ICU delirium and coma

-   Goal: allow pt to “prove us wrong” about readiness for liberation
    from devices, sedatives, etc.
-   Evidence
    
    Associated with higher likelihood of ICU and hospital discharge and
    lower likelihood of death, mechanical ventilation, coma, delirium,
    physical restraint, ICU readmission, discharge to a destination
    other than home, and lower cost

A

ssess, prevent, and manage pain

-   Tools to assess pain using facial expressions, body movements,
    muscle tension, compliance with ventilator, or vocalization for
    extubated pts
    -   Behavioral Pain Scale (BPS): scale 0-12, uncontrolled pain ≥ 5
    -   Critical Care Pain Observation Tool (CPOT): scale 0-8,
        uncontrolled pain 3 if non-verbal pt
-   Uncontrolled pain increases risk for delirium, limits inspiratory
    effort and weaning from ventilator, and limits ability to mobilize
-   Treatment: multi-modal with parenteral opioids (e.g., fentanyl,
    dilaudid), neuropathic meds (e.g., gabapentin, ketamine), adjunctive
    non-opioids analgesics (e.g., acetaminophen, NSAIDs),
    nonpharmacologic interventions (repositioning, heat/cold)

B

oth spontaneous awakening trials (SATs) and spontaneous breathing trials
(SBTs)

-   SATs = daily sedative interruptions
    -   RN-driven protocol involving safety checklist: no active
        seizures, alcohol withdrawal, agitation, paralytics, myocardial
        infarction, or increased ICP
    -   If pass SAT, then proceed to SBT
    -   If fail SAT (anxiety, agitation, pain, resp distress)
        
        restart sedation at ½ doses
-   SBTs = PS ventilation (Fi02 ≤ 50%, PEEP ≤ 7.5; typically 40% and
    5/5) for ≥ 30 minutes
    -   RT or physician/APP-driven protocol with safety screen: passed
        SAT, O2 sat ≥ 88%, inspiratory efforts, no myocardial ischemia,
        no/low vasopressor support
    -   If pass SBT, physician/APP judgment on extubation
    -   If fail SBT (RR > 35 or \< 8, O2 sat \< 88%, resp distress,
        mental status change)
        
        restart full ventilatory support
-   Evidence:
    -   Liberated pts from mechanical ventilation 3 days sooner,
        decreased ICU and hospital length of stay by 4 days, and 14%
        absolute reduction in mortality at 1 year

C

hoice of analgesia and sedation

-   Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS): sedation and level of
    arousal assessment tool (Figure 1)
    -   Target light sedation of RASS -1 to 0 with goal of (1) pt
        following commands without agitation and (2) limiting
        immobilization
    -   Over-sedation:  hold sedatives till target, then restart at ½
        prior dose
-   Analgosedation with focus on treating pain first and then adding
    sedation meds PRN
-   Sedatives: dexmedetomidine (dex) or propofol >\>\> benzodiazepines
    -   Benzodiazepines increase risk of delirium in a dose-dependent
        fashion

elirium - assess, prevent, and manage

-   Screening for delirium: q4hr using CAM-ICU (Figure 2)
    -   Affects 60-80% of ventilated pts and associated with increased
        morbidity and mortality, longer ICU and hospital length of stay,
        long-term cognitive dysfunction
-   Risk factors and treatment: see Delirium topic under Geriatrics
    -   Dr. Dre mnemonic: **<u>D</u>** isease **<u>r</u>** emediation
        (heart failure, COPD, and sepsis), **<u>D</u>** rug **<u>r</u>**
        emoval (benzos, anticholinergics, steroids) and **<u>E</u>**
        nvironment (hearing aids, eye glasses, mobilize the pt,
        normalize sleep wake cycle)

E

arly mobility and Exercise

-   Prolonged immobilization during critical illness leads to
    ICU-acquired weakness, associated with worse outcomes:
    ↑
    mechanical ventilation, increased hospital length of stay, greater
    mortality, and greater disability
-   Consult PT/OT to initiate rehab at the beginning of critical illness
    -   Can be done safely in pts receiving advanced support
    -   ↓
        duration of delirium,
        ↓
        ICU and hospital length of stay, and improved return to
        independent functional status

F

amily engagement and empowerment

-   Especially important when pts are unable to communicate themselves
-   Incorporate family at the bedside and on rounds to learn pt
    preferences and values, engage in shared-decision making, and
    address questions and concerns
    -   Associated with greater satisfaction with care and increased
        feelings of inclusion, respect, and understanding of the pt’s
        care
    -   Can facilitate family decision to transition to comfort-focused
        care
