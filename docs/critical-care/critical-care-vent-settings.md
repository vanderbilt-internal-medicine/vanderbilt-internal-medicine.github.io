Ventilator Settings:

-   FiO2 or Fraction of inspired oxygen (%)
-   PEEP or Positive End Expiratory Pressure (mmHg)
-   RR or respiratory rate (breaths per minute)
-   Vt or Tidal volume (mL) \[in VC modes or PRVC\]
-   Pressure Support above PEEP \[in PC/PS modes\]
-   Flow rate: how fast a volume is delivered; adjusting this variable
    changes the inspiratory to expiratory (I:E) time in volume control
    ventilator modes
-   Trigger: what initiates a breath; time, flow, or pressure (pt
    triggers are flow and pressure)
-   Cycle: when to stop delivering breath; time (pressure control
    modes), flow (pressure support modes), or volume (volume control
    modes)
-   Alarms: peak pressure, low pressure, minute ventilation, pt
    disconnect

Static Ventilator Readouts:

-   Plateau pressure (P <sub>plat</sub> ): measure with inspiratory hold
    (i.e. breath held at the end of inspiration and pressure measured);
    assesses static lung compliance
-   Auto-PEEP: measure with expiratory hold; occurs when volume of
    previous breath is not entirely expelled before the next breath is
    initiated

Dynamic Ventilator Readouts:

-   Measured RR: in most modes, pt may trigger breaths above set RR; if
    set and measured RR match, 2/2
    ↓
    respiratory drive (over sedated, neurologic injury) or iatrogenic
    over-ventilation
-   VTi / VTe: tidal volume of inspiration (VTi) and expiration (VTe);
    VTi should approximately equal VTe, if not then concern for air leak
    (e.g. cuff leak or pneumothorax) or auto-PEEP
-   Minute ventilation: calculated from VTe x RR; higher MV = more CO2
    clearance
-   Peak pressure: highest pressure reached in the entire ventilator
    cycle

Critical Non-ventilator Hemodynamic Readouts:

-   SpO2: if poor waveform or discordant with PaO2, may need serial ABG
-   HR: quickest indicator of emergencies such as pneumothorax, PE,
    ventilator disconnection
-   Blood pressure (cuff or arterial line): positive pressure
    ventilation decreases preload and decreases afterload; depending on
    the underlying pt physiology, increases in positive pressure may be
    detrimental or beneficial for BP

Ventilator troubleshooting:

-   Peak Pressure Alarm: either a problem with the ability of the lung
    to stretch (compliance) or with airflow in the tubing (resistance);
    the inspiratory hold will remove the movement of air and give you a
    plateau pressure; if plateau pressure is high lung compliance is the
    issue, if it is normal airflow (resistance) is the issue.
    -   Compliance Issues: processes filling the alveoli (ARDS, DAH,
        pulmonary edema), abdominal compartment syndrome,
        circumferential burn, kyphosis, obesity, PTX, mainstem
        intubation
    -   Resistance Issues: bronchospasm, mucous plug, biting the tube,
        kink in the tubing from the endotracheal tube to the machine,
        water in the tubing

<!-- -->

-   Low Minute Ventilation Alarm (this reports EXHALED minute
    ventilation): either your pt is apneic or there is a leak in your
    system and remember the system may also be in the pt; fix the leak;
    if they are not on a mode with a set RR, please ask for this to be
    switched.
    -   This should also be the alarm for ventilator disconnection.

-   Refractory hypoxemia: see dedicated section below
-   At the VA, you may adjust the vents as your discretion but always
    inform the RT as a courtesy
-   At VUMC, do NOT adjust the ventilator, please ask RT to make
    adjustments
    -   There are many trials going on at the VUMC MICU that you do not
        want to interfere with
