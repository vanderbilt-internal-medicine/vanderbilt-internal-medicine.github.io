| Distributive Shock                                 |

Background

-   Pathophysiology: severe, peripheral vasodilation
    -   CO/CI increased, SVR decreased, PCWP and RAP normal to low

<!-- -->

-   Etiologies: sepsis (far and away the most common cause of
    distributive shock), anaphylaxis, neurogenic, adrenal insufficiency,
    pancreatitis

<!-- -->

-   Signs/symptoms:
    -   Sepsis: localizing signs of infection; tachycardic, tachypnic,
        may be hypo/hyperthermic; POCUS with hyperdynamic cardiac
        function
    -   Anaphylaxis: history of anaphylaxis; urticaria, edema, diarrhea,
        wheezing on exam
    -   Neurogenic: history of CNS trauma; focal neurologic deficits on
        exam
    -   Adrenal insufficiency: hx chronic steroid use, may have GI
        symptoms, hyponatremia (common), hyperkalemia (rare),
        hypoglycemia, hypo/hyperthermia, NAGMA
    -   Pancreatitis: abdominal pain, elevated lipase, evidence on CT
        scan

Management

-   Sepsis: see sepsis section
-   Anaphylaxis: 0.3mg IM epinephrine ASAP to be repeated q5-15min x 3;
    after third IM epi, consider IVF and epi gtt if persistent
    hypotension. Adjuncts: albuterol nebs for bronchospasm, H1 and H2
    blockers (Benadryl 25-50mg IV, ranitidine 50mg IV), +/-
    glucocorticoids (methylprednisolone 1mg/kg). EPINEPHRINE SAVES
    LIVES.
-   Neurogenic: caution with IVF resuscitation, which can worsen
    cerebral and spinal cord edema; preferred pressors are
    norepinephrine and phenylephrine; for neurogenic shock 2/2 spinal
    cord pathology, consider higher MAP goal 85-90 mmHg
-   Adrenal insufficiency: initiate stress dose steroids with
    hydrocortisone 100mg IV q8hr or 50mg q6hr; can also trial stress
    dose steroids on pts on 2-3 pressors
-   Pancreatitis: IVF (though at risk for over-resuscitation) +
    pressors; trend H/H and Ca; treat complications (necrotizing
    pancreatitis, abdominal compartment syndrome); address underlying
    etiology (gallstones, hypertriglyceridemia, hypercalcemia)

| Cardiogenic Shock |

Background

-   Pathophysiology: CO/CI decreased, SVR increased, PCWP and RAP
    elevated (left heart failure) or PCWP low/normal and RAP elevated
    (right heart failure)
-   Etiologies: Cardiomyopathy (LHF, RHF or biventricular), Arrhythmia,
    Mechanical such as acute AR (ex: dissection) or MR (ex: ruptured
    papillary muscle)

Presentation

-   Edematous, elevated JVP, “cold and wet”; hypoxia w/crackles and pulm
    edema on CXR; mixed venous sat \< 50-60%; POCUS with plump,
    non-compressible IVC, reduced EF, and B-lines

Management

Immediate assessment for acute ischemic event

-   Pulmonary artery catheters may be helpful for titrating therapies
-   Hallmark therapies:
    -   -   -   Preload
                
                aggressive diuresis, frequently need bumex or lasix gtt
            -   Inotropy
                
                dobutamine or milrinone gtt, both can cause arrhythmias,
                hypotension, reflex tachycardia; epi is also a good
                choice and a more familiar choice for MICU staff.
                Caution with milrinone in renal dysfunction.
            -   Afterload Reduction
                
                nitroglycerine gtt; hydralazine + ISDN for PO options;
                treat hypotension with pressors/inotropes if needed
-   Acute Right Heart Failure is highly susceptible to R-sided coronary
    ischemia, consider vasopressin as beneficial in improving R-sided
    coronary blood flow

<!-- -->

-   Arrhythmia: See mgmt in “arrhythmia,” In general, unstable
    tachyarrhythmia
    
    cardioversion. Unstable bradyarrhythmia
    
    pacing. Avoid negative inotropes (BB, CCB)

| Hypovolemic Shock |

Background

-   Etiologies: Hemorrhagic and non-hemorrhagic

<!-- -->

-   Signs/symptoms:
    -   Hemorrhagic: Common sources include GI, retroperitoneal (\*needs
        high index of suspicion), traumatic. Other sources of
        significant hemorrhage include intraabdominal, thighs, thorax.
    -   Non-hemorrhagic: generally 2/2 GI losses—history of diarrhea,
        emesis; can also be 2/2 decreased PO intake
    -   POCUS with thin, collapsible IVC

Management (Hemorrhagic)

-   Ensure good access with two large-bore (at least 18G) IVs ideally in
    AC or above; Cordis or MAC CVC (can also use dialysis catheter, if
    necessary)
-   Hyperacute bleed:
    -   1:1:1 ratio FFP:Plt:RBC (balanced resuscitation), massive
        transfusion protocol (MTP)
    -   Monitor iCa and replete (citrated blood products will deplete
        Ca)
    -   Minimize crystalloid, if possible, w/primary use to prevent
        immediate hemodynamic collapse (contributes to coagulopathy,
        hypothermia, acidemia, trauma/surgery)
    -   Permissive hypotension until source control/transfusions with
        arterial bleeds (high MAP/SBP --> clot destabilization); trend
        POC lactate/exam to guide
    -   Acute traumatic arterial bleed or post-partum hemorrhage
        consider TXA (1-2 gm bolus)
    -   Reverse anticoagulation, if applicable
    -   Vasopressors --> generally poorly effective, would start with
        norepinephrine
    -   Source control --> GI, IR, or EGS
-   Variceal bleed: See GI Bleeding section for specific management

Management (Non-Hemorrhagic)

-   Aggressive IVF resuscitation (balanced crystalloid); target MAP ≥65
-   Can support BP during resuscitation with pressors (usually
    norepinephrine)

| Obstructive Shock |

Background

-   Etiologies:
    -   Massive pulmonary embolism, tension pneumothorax, and cardiac
        tamponade

<!-- -->

-   Signs/symptoms:
    -   Pulmonary embolism: acute hypotension, known DVT, evidence of R
        heart strain on EKG, POCUS w/enlarged RV, septal bowing,
        McConnell’s sign,
        ↑
        BNP, PE on CTA
    -   Tension pneumothorax: history of COPD or fibrotic lung disease,
        ventilated pts w/ high peak pressures, unilateral decreased BS
        on auscultation and tympany on percussion, POCUS without lung
        sliding, CXR w/ PTX and mediastinal shift
    -   Cardiac tamponade: elevated JVP, muffled heart sounds, pulsus
        paradoxus, POCUS with diastolic collapse of RV and large
        pericardial effusion (best in subcostal window)

Management

-   Massive pulmonary embolism: see Pulmonary Embolism Section for
    specific management
-   Tension PTX: needle decompression using 14-16G needle into the
    second intercostal space at the midclavicular line; call thoracic
    surgery or fellow for chest tube ASAP
-   Cardiac tamponade: STAT page cardiology or cardiothoracic surgery;
    can temporize hypotension with IVF resuscitation—500-1L IVF boluses
    (may not work if pt is euvolemic or hypervolemic); no proven benefit
    from inotropy (e.g., dobutamine)
