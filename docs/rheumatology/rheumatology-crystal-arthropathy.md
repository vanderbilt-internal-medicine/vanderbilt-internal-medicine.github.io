# Crystalline Arthropathies 

Thomas Horton

# Gout

## Presentation

- Red, hot, swollen joint (classically affects 1st metatarsal
    phalangeal joint \[podagra\])

- May progress to involve ankles, knees, elbows, and small joints of
    hand if untreated

    - Flares may also become polyarticular over time

- Gout is diagnosed with combination of clinical presentation and
    arthrocentesis results

- Lifestyle factors:

    - Protective: Low fat dairy, hydration, weight loss, smoking cessation

    - Promoting: Meat, seafood, alcohol, high fructose corn syrup,
        medications that lead to hyperuricemia (ex: thiazides)

## Evaluation

- Synovial Fluid Analysis: 

    - Cell count and differential: WBC 20,000-100,000, \> 50% neutrophils

    - Order gram stain/culture (It is possible to have septic arthritis
        and gout)

    - Examination for crystals under polarizing light microscopy: (order
        “Synovial Fluid Eval” so the lab knows to look for crystals)

        - Monosodium urate crystals: needle-shaped and negatively
            birefringent and appear yellow when parallel to the polarizer

- Imaging: generally unnecessary

    - MSK ultrasound: "Double contour sign" (hyperechoic band = urate
        crystals deposits)

    - Radiographs: Punched out erosions or lytic areas with overhanging
        edges

    - Dual energy CT scan: gout crystal aggregates appear green. Not
        routinely necessary; Do not order without rheumatology consult

## Management

Acute:

- Do not discontinue allopurinol during an acute gout attack

- NSAIDs (if not contraindicated): Short course (2-5 days) at full
    anti-inflammatory dose: ibuprofen 800 mg TID, indomethacin 50 mg
    TID, naproxen 500 mg BID

- Colchicine (avoid if GFR \<10 mL/min. Dose reduce by 50% if GFR \<50
    mL/min)

    - Best if used within the first 36 hours of an attack. Much less
        effective if started later.

    - Dosing: 1.2 mg then 0.6 mg one hour later, then 0.6 mg daily until
        clinical improvement

        - Note drug interactions that may require dose adjustment of
            colchicine: Statins, diltiazem, fluconazole, cyclosporine,
            tacrolimus, clarithromycin, etc.

- Steroids:

    - Ideally intra-articular if single joint affected and infection has
        been ruled out

    - Oral prednisone, dose 0.5mg/kg/day until clinical improvement then
        taper over 7-14 days

- Anakinra (IL-1 receptor antagonist): 100mg once daily for three days
    (or QOD for CrCl \<30). Requires rheumatology consult. For patients
    with contraindications to all other treatments

## Chronic:

- Urate Lowering Therapy (ULT)

    - Indications: Strong: \>2 attacks/year, one or more subcutaneous
        tophi, radiologic changes. Conditional: CKD 3 or worse,
        urolithiasis, serum urate \>9

    - Goal serum urate: \<6.0 mg/dL, or \<5.0 mg/dL in patients with tophi

    - ULT can precipitate an acute gout flare and should always be started
        with low-dose NSAIDs, colchicine (0.6 mg) or prednisone (5 mg daily
        or QOD)

        - Prophylaxis should be continued for at least 6 months until uric
            acid is at goal and tophi have resolved

    - Allopurinol (xanthine oxidase inhibitor): Start low at 100 mg per
        day (sometimes even 50mg daily in those with advanced CKD) and
        increase as needed for target uric acid \<6 (most patients will need
        400-800 mg daily)

        - Adjust dose monthly (3-4 weeks). In kidney dysfunction go
            slower.

        - Titration of allopurinol ↓ both the risk of acute gout attacks
            and DRESS syndrome

        - Genetic testing (HLA-B\*5801) recommended prior to starting for
            pts of Asian and African descent given ↑ incidence of
            allopurinol hypersensitivity if + positive allele

    - Febuxostat: alternative xanthine oxidase inhibitor that is
        metabolized by the liver for pts at risk for DRESS or SJS related to
        allopurinol. Black box warning for ↑ cardiovascular risk; more
        expensive than allopurinol

- Consider Rheumatology consult for patients with refractory serum
    urate levels \>6.0 on XOI

## Additional pearls

- There is a microscope in the rheumatology clinic at VUMC (TVC 2);
    You can page the rheumatology fellow and they are happy to help you
    use it

- Uric acid level is often normal during acute gout flare

- Shifts in uric acid may be the trigger of the flare: Diuresis,
    dietary changes, hospital stays

- Eliminating uric acid from the diet only reduces uric acid by \~1
    mg/dL. Urate lowering therapy will be needed in most patients even
    if diet changed

- VA specific guidance:

    - Colchicine is non-formulary but is easily approved

    - For steroid intra-articular injections triamcinolone is the
        formulary option

# Pseudogout- Calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystal deposition disease
(CPPD)

## Presentation

- Red, hot, swollen joint usually in the wrists, knees, or MCP joints

- Cannot distinguish from gout based on clinical features alone. Like
    gout, diagnosis is based on exam and arthrocentesis

- More prevalent in the elderly populations

Evaluation

- Synovial Fluid:

    - Cell count and differential: WBC 20,000 to 100,000, \>50%
        neutrophils

    - Order gram stain/culture (It is possible to have septic arthritis
        and CPPD)

    - Examination for crystals under polarizing light microscopy

        - CPPD crystals: rhomboid-shaped, weakly positively birefringent
            and appear blue when parallel to the polarizer

- Imaging: 

    - XR: chondrocalcinosis (thin calcified line present in
        fibrocartilage) in the joint space (easiest to see in knee and
        wrists)

## Management

- Typically follows the same treatment used for acute gout attacks
    (see above, little evidence)

- Some patients may develop Chronic CPP Crystal Inflammatory
    Arthritis.

    - Resembles RA in presentation

    - Treatment base on symptoms and ranges from NSAIDs (1st line) to
        > Colchicine, HCQ, and steroids. Can also use anakinra in acute
        > cases, with consult to rheumatology

## Additional Information

- CPPD can be associated with other disorders: hyperparathyroidism,
    hemochromatosis, hypomagnesemia, hypophosphatemia, and familial
    hypocalciuric hypercalcemia

    - Consider further workup for these conditions, especially in a
        > younger patient.
