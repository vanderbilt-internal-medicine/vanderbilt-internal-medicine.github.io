# Vasculitis

Vasculitides – Trever Stevens and Greg Jackson

Background

-   Large
    vessel vasculitides
    \- affect the Aorta and its major branches:
    -   Takayasu's
        Arteritis: most commonly affects \<50 years old and young Asian
        Females
        -   Branches of the aorta and aortic arch (subclavian,
            innominate, and carotid arteries)
    -   Giant
        Cell: most commonly affects adults >50 years old
        -   Almost never seen under the age of 50; and affects F>M
            slightly
        -   Cranial arteries like the temporal artery, although can
            involve aorta and its branches
-   Medium
    vessel vasculitides
    \- affect the muscular arteries that supply visceral organs:
    -   PAN: Necrotizing vasculitis, involves muscular arteries
        including the renal arteries, mesenteric artery, and arteries
        that supply neurons and the skin
        -   PAN **spares the lung** (consider other process if pulmonary
            complaints)
        -   Affects middle age to older adults (peaks at 5th decade of
            life)
        -   Can be associated with HBV infection and HBsAg
    -   Kawasaki’s: most commonly affects children (not addressed here)
-   Small
    Vessel Vasculitides
    \- affect arterioles, capillaries, and venules
    -   Cryoglobulinemic vasculitis and Henoch Schonlein Purpura - not
        discussed here
    -   GPA
        : Necrotizing and granulomatous; involves the nasopharynx,
        lungs, and kidneys
    -   MPA
        :
        Necrotizing
        ; affects multiple organs, predilection for lungs and kidneys
        -   Nasopharyngeal involvement and granulomas are **absent**
            (contrast to GPA)
    -   EGPA: Granulomatous
        necrotizing inflammation with eosinophilia
        -   Uncommon over the age of 65; predilection for heart and
            lungs

Takayasu's Arteritis

Presentation

-   Unequal pulses, arterial bruits, or different BP in both arms (known
    as “pulseless disease”)
-   Constitutional symptoms: fevers, arthralgias, myalgias, rash, weight
    loss
-   Can also cause carotidynia (tenderness of carotid artery),
    lightheadedness, vertigo, headaches, syncope, and strokes due to
    involvement of carotid arteries



Evaluation

-   Inflammatory markers: ESR & CRP (usually elevated)
-   Arteriography: MRA or CTA of head/neck, chest, and abdomen



Management

-   If signs of aortitis/carotidynia or arterial stenosis: 1mg/kg
    prednisone daily (max 60-80mg/kg) for 2-4 weeks followed by steroid
    taper
-   Organ threatening disease or ischemia: 500-1000 mg IV
    methylprednisolone (1-3 days) then 1mg/kg prednisone daily (2-4
    weeks) followed by steroid taper
-   MTX, immunomodulators

Giant Cell Arteritis

Presentation

-   In a pt >65 with headache and vision changes (diplopia or amaurosis
    fugax) this needs to be ruled out!
-   Classically presents as headache, jaw claudication, tenderness to
    palpation of scalp in addition to constitutional symptoms
-   Polymyalgia rheumatica will often accompany GCA
    -   B/l shoulder and hip pain and stiffness (elevated ESR but normal
        CK)

Evaluation

-   Order ESR, CRP, CK level, TSH
-   Detailed vascular exam for (4 limb blood pressures with attention to
    symmetry, abdominal/neck/chest auscultation for bruit)
-   Ophthalmology eval if there is ocular involvement.
-   Temporal artery biopsy – evaluating for evidence of vasculitis or
    giant cells
    -   (Vascular surgery can assist with timely biopsy)

Management

-   If ESR is elevated in a moderate to high probability setting, give
    steroids without delay (biopsy results will be unaffected if done
    within \~2 weeks)
-   Without visual loss: prednisone 1mg/kg (max of 60 mg) daily
-   With visual loss or diplopia: 100-1000mg of IV methylprednisolone
    daily for 3 days, followed by prednisone 1mg/kg daily (max of 60mg)
-   Duration: daily high-dose steroids as above for 2-4 weeks, then
    begin to taper steroids

Polyarteritis Nodosa (PAN)

Presentation

-   Constitutional symptoms: fevers, arthralgias, myalgias, rash, weight
    loss
-   Asymmetric polyneuropathy (most common symptom) & **both** motor and
    sensory deficits
-   Foot drop, radial and ulnar neuropathies
-   Hypertension if renal artery involvement
-   Abdominal pain and melena if mesenteric artery inflammation
-   Skin manifestations: livedo reticularis, palpable purpura, or tender
    erythematous nodules

Evaluation

-   ESR, CRP, CK level, TSH
-   Arteriography: MRI or CT or catheter based angiogram - “string of
    pearls” appearance
-   Histology: fibrinoid necrosis and vasculitis in target tissue

Management

-   Hepatitis screening if not previously done to evaluate for HBsAg
-   Mild disease or isolated cutaneous disease: Glucocorticoids
-   Moderate disease: Up to 1mg/kg prednisone daily (up to 60-80mg max)
    for 2-4 weeks followed by steroid taper +/- DMARD
-   Severe disease or life threatening disease (evidence of renal
    insufficiency, significant proteinuria, gastrointestinal, cardiac,
    or neurologic involvement): 500-1000mg IV methylprednisolone daily
    for up to 3 doses followed by prednisone as above for 4 weeks with
    taper plus cyclophosphamide

Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA)

Presentation

-   Sinus and respiratory symptoms, sinusitis/ulcers, hemoptysis
-   Renal involvement – elevated Cr, hematuria, or proteinuria from RPGN
-   Less commonly affects eyes (scleritis: red, painful, light
    sensitive), skin (palpable purpura), peripheral nerves (mononeuritis
    multiplex)

Evaluation

-   ANCA + (Usually PR3-cANCA > MPO-pANCA)
-   U/A with urine microscopy: need to spin the urine to evaluate for
    active renal disease
-   Biopsy of a site of suspected disease activity (necrotizing
    granulomatous vasculitis)

Management

-   If treating inpatient, has 20x increase risk of DVT/PE – ensure DVT
    ppx
-   Mild to moderate disease: MTX + glucocorticoids
-   Severe disease: rituximab or cyclophosphamide, then maintenance w/
    Rituxan or DMARD

Microscopic Polyangiitis (MPA)

Presentation

-   Similar to GPA but will only involve kidneys and lungs (less sinus
    involvement)
-   Hemoptysis with bilateral nodular lung involvement and
    hematuria/proteinuria common

Evaluation

-   ANCA +, typically MPO-pANCA
-   U/A with urine microscopy: need to spin the urine to evaluate for
    active renal disease
-   Biopsy of a site of suspected diseased activity

Management

-   DVT ppx is important as patients are at higher risk for DVTs/PE
-   Mild to moderate disease: MTX (or similar DMARD) + glucocorticoids
-   Severe disease: rituximab or cyclophosphamide, then maintenance
    w/Rituxan or DMARD

Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (EGPA or Churg-Strauss
Syndrome)

Presentation

-   Similar to MPA and GPA; unique symptoms include atopic symptoms
    (asthma, etc.)
    -   Asthma is the most common symptom with involvement in over 90%
        of patients
-   Can have Peripheral eosinophilia
-   More likely small vessel vasculitis to cause cardiac tissue
    involvement: Coronary arteritis, myocarditis, heart failure and
    arrhythmias
-   Skin lesions: tender subcutaneous nodules
-   Renal involvement: hematuria and proteinuria

Evaluation

-   ANCA + (typically MPO-pANCA) and peripheral eosinophilia
-   Histology: Eosinophilic infiltrates with fibrinoid necrosis

Management

-   DVT prophylaxis as patients are high risk for DVTs/PE
-   Mild to moderate disease: MTX (or similar DMARD) + glucocorticoids
-   Severe disease (cardiac or neurologic involvement): cyclophosphamide
    induction with maintenance DMARD, Rituximab
