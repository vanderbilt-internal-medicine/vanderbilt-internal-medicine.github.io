# Inflammatory Myopathies

Inflammatory Myopathies – Greg Jackson

Background

-   Inflammation and damage of skeletal muscle primarily leading to
    weakness
-   Subtypes: Dermatomyositis, polymyositis, statin-induced myositis,
    inclusion body myositis, metabolic (hypothyroid, electrolyte)
    myositis, viral/infection myositis, diabetic myonecrosis
-   Important point: this differs from PMR in that myopathy presentation
    is usually painless weakness whereas PMR will have myalgias with
    preserved strength
-   Hypomyopathic (or amyopathic) variants: skin and/or lungs are
    affected >\> muscles

Presentation

-   Proximal, symmetric muscle weakness in upper and lower extremities
    in all but inclusion body myositis which is typically more distal
    and asymmetric
-   Dermatomyositis: skin involvement can include heliotrope rash of
    upper eyelids, Gottron’s papules (on MCP, PIP), “mechanic’s hands,”
    and shawl sign
-   Raynaud’s and arthralgias can also be present

Evaluation

-   BMP & TSH ; CK level
-   Anti Jo-1 most common specific antibody
-   EMG: findings indicate myopathy
-   MRI extremity/affected muscle group: muscle edema
-   Skin biopsy in dermatomyositis: “interface dermatitis.”
-   Muscle biopsy (do not do biopsy in same muscle as EMG done)
    -   Polymyositis, inclusion body myositis: T cell mediated muscle
        injury
    -   Dermatomyositis: immune complex/B cell mediated muscle injury



Management

-   Prednisone 1 mg/kg/day for 4-6 weeks with subsequent taper
-   Consult Rheumatology
-   MTX or AZA used if refractory to steroids, may need IVIG, rituximab
-   If statin induced: stop statin or switch to lower intensity
-   If dermatomyositis: evaluate for underlying malignancy
