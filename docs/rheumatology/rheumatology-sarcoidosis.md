# Sarcoidosis 

Jared Freitas

## Background

- Multisystem disordered defined by forming noncaseating granulomas in
    different tissues

- Cardiac and neuro manifestations can be isolated

## Presentation

- Constitutional symptoms: fatigue, night sweats, weight loss, fevers,
    arthralgias, myalgias

- Pulmonary symptoms (most common): dyspnea, cough, and wheezing

- Extrapulmonary manifestations:

<!-- -->

    - Cutaneous: Highly variable, but present in 25% of patients

        - Papules, macules, or plaques commonly involving neck, upper
            back, extremities

        - Lupus pernio: indurated, violaceous bumps on nose, lips, cheeks,
            ears

        - Erythema nodosum

    - Neuro

        - Affects 5-10% pts; involving any part of CNS or PNS

        - CN palsies, hypothalamic/pituitary dysfunction, seizures,
            myelopathy or radiculopathy, hydrocephalus, aseptic meningitis

    - Cardiac

        - Granulomas can affect pericardium, myocardium and endocardium
            resulting in valvular disorders, conduction system and
            cardiomyopathy

    - Liver/Spleen

        - Granulomas in liver and spleen can lead to elevated LFTs,
            cirrhosis, anemia, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia (splenic
            sequestration)

    - Ocular

        - Uveitis, secondary glaucoma, retinal vasculitis,
            keratoconjunctivitis

## Work Up

- Combination of clinical features, radiographic manifestations,
    exclusion of other similarly presenting diseases, and noncaseating
    granulomas on pathology

<!-- -->

    - CXR: hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy ± pulmonary infiltrates

    - High-Resolution Chest CT

        - Lymphadenopathy (bilateral and symmetric), with micro or
            macronodules, fibrotic changes (reticular opacities, traction
            bronchiectasis, volume loss)

    - PFTs

        - May show restrictive disease (decreased TLC & VC) and diffusion
            impairment (reduced DLCO). Occasionally obstructive with
            endobronchial disease.

    - Labs: CBC w/ diff, CMP, UA, quant-gold for TB. ACE level is of
        limited clinical use

    - Biopsy

        - Important to rule out mimics. The differential for “noncaseating
            granulomas” is extensive, including lymphoma and fungal
            infections.

        - Not required for pts w/ asymptomatic bilateral hilar adenopathy
            or Lofgren syndrome (fever, erythema nodosum, arthralgias, and
            bilateral hilar LAD)

## Management

- Most pts do not require therapy: monitor symptoms, CXR, PFTs at 3-6
    month intervals

- Indications for treatment: progressive disease or severe disease at
    presentation

- Mainstay of treatment is oral steroids:

    - Dosing usually 0.3-0.6 mg/kg daily for 4-6 weeks

    - If only symptoms is cough, could consider inhaled glucocorticoids

- If unresponsive or unable to tolerate steroids may require
    alternative agents (MTX, AZA)
