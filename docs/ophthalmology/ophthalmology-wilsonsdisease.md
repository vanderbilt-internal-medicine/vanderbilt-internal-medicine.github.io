# Wilson’s Disease: Ophthalmic Manifestations

- The two classic ophthalmic manifestations of Wilson’s disease are
    the “Kayser-Fleischer ring” (copper deposition around the corneal
    limbus) and the “Sunflower cataract” (copper deposition in the
    lens).

- Wilson’s disease rarely affects vision (unless the sunflower
    cataract is very advanced).

- Unless the disease is very advanced/has been present for years, it
    is impossible for one to detect subtle copper deposition in the
    cornea, iridocorneal angle, or lens without an office-based slit
    lamp exam and gonioscopy (only available in the outpatient setting).

    - Furthermore, the presence or absence of a Kayser-Fleischer ring does
        not rule in or rule out the disease

    - Testing for decreased ceruloplasmin, urinary copper levels, and
        genetic testing are more effective diagnostic methods.

- If concerned about the visual impact of a developing sunflower
    cataract, an outpatient ophthalmology referral is appropriate.
