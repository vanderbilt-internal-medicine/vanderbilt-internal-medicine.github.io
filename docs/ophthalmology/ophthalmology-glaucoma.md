# Glaucoma

## Background

- Glaucoma is a disease of the optic nerve that follows a
    characteristic pattern of optic nerve fiber degeneration.

- High intraocular pressure (IOP) is believed to be the main etiology
    of the disease.

- While the “normal” IOP range is between 11 and 21 mmHg, there are
    individuals who have a pressure above 21 that do NOT develop
    glaucoma. Conversely, there are individuals who have a pressure in
    the normal range that DO develop glaucoma (= Normal Tension
    Glaucoma).

- Aqueous humor fills the anterior chamber and drains through a
    sieve-like structure called the trabecular meshwork (TM), located in
    the angle between the iris and the cornea. After passing through TM,
    aqueous drains into the eye’s venous system. Impediment to aqueous
    flow will cause elevated IOP.

## Presentation

- All glaucomas generally cause progressive peripheral visual field
    loss that ultimately encroaches on central fixation and leads to
    irreversible blindness if left untreated.

- A glaucomatous optic nerve is often described as “cupped”

- Presents in an acute or chronic fashion:

- Acute Angle-Closure Glaucoma

    - The iridocorneal angle rapidly closes, blocking aqueous drainage
        and causing a sudden rise in IOP (usually \>40mmHg).

    - Symptoms and Signs: intense eye or orbital pain, headache,
        nausea/vomiting, blurred vision, halos around lights, fixed and
        mid-dilated pupil, rock-hard eye, conjunctival redness, cloudy
        cornea.

    - Usually unilateral, but occasionally can be bilateral.

    - Classic trigger is a pupil-dilating factor (e.g., dark
        environment or anticholinergic medications) in a person with
        anatomically narrow angles.

    - If IOP is not lowered within hours, permanent optic nerve damage
        and vision loss will likely occur.

- Primary Open Angle Glaucoma (POAG)

    - The iridocorneal angle is open, but due to inadequately
        functioning TM (or other mechanism) aqueous does not drain
        properly and IOP is chronically elevated.

    - POAG is often painless and without noticeable vision changes in
        the early stage of disease. Individuals can go undiagnosed for
        years, sitting at an IOP of say 30mmHg, without being aware they
        are losing vision until the vision loss is severe.

    - POAG is the most common glaucoma in the US. When a patient says
        they have a history of glaucoma, they probably have POAG.

## Evaluation and Management

- Primary Open Angle:

<!-- -->

- Continue the patient’s home glaucoma drops; caution if they develop
    a medical condition that results in a contraindication (See table
    below)

- No need to officially place an Ophthalmology consult to order a
    patient’s home glaucoma drops; feel free to page Ophthalmology if
    you have questions.

- Pro tip: Often patients will remember the cap color of the drops
    they take but not the names!

- Acute Angle Closure:

<!-- -->

- If suspect acute angle closure given the signs described above,
    consult Ophthalmology ASAP.

- The goal is to lower the IOP ASAP. Target is \<30mmHg.

- Administer frequent rotating rounds of all the IOP-lowering drops: 1
    drop of Cosopt (then wait 5 minutes), followed by Brimonidine (then
    wait 5 minutes), followed by Latanoprost (then wait 5 minutes)--then
    keep repeating the cycle until the IOP goes down.

- Concurrently, administer one dose of IV Diamox 500mg if not
    contraindicated (e.g., renal insufficiency or hepatic cirrhosis).
    Ophthalmology will recheck the IOP every hour or so to ensure that
    the IOP is responding (usually it does).

- If the IOP does not respond, patient will need a bedside AC tap to
    offload aqueous and lower the pressure.

- Patient should ultimately get a Laser Peripheral Iridotomy (LPI) to
    avoid future angle-closure attacks, which is typically performed as
    an outpatient procedure.
