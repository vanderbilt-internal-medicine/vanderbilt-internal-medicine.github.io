## Key Points

- This flowchart is meant to serve as a guide. Bear in mind that there
    are always exceptions.

- Scintillating or colorful lights/spots, especially if bilateral, are
    likely migrainous in nature.

- A patient may say they see a visual disturbance in the left eye,
    when in reality it is in the left visual field of both eyes
    (indicating that it is a neurological issue, e.g., migraine). Ask if
    the patient has tried closing one eye to see if the visual
    phenomenon is actually in one eye.

- Rapid onset of floaters, often preceded by a peripheral
    crescent-shaped light flash, is classic for posterior vitreous
    detachment. A black curtain or veil that comes down in the vision is
    classic for retinal detachment.
