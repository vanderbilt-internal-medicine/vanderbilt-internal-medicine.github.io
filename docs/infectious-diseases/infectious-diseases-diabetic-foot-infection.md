# Diabetic Foot Infection

Diabetic Foot Infection – VASP

Evaluation

-   Plain radiograph for all pts; MRI w/contrast if abscess/osteo
    suspected
-   BCx (prior to antibiotics) if systemic signs of infection, or severe
    infection
    -   Do not culture swab of lesions, as these generally only grow
        colonizing organisms.
-   Consult podiatry if osteomyelitis present for bone specimen culture
    and pathology (either from debridement specimen or bone biopsy)
    prior to starting antibiotics.
-   Consult surgery if c/f abscess, gas in tissue, joint involvement
-   Assess peripheral vasculature, consider arterial flow
    studies/vascular surgery consult

Management

-   Assess Severity:
    -   Mild: Local infxn, skin/subQ tissue only, erythema >0.5 cm but
        ≤2cm from ulcer
    -   Moderate: Local infxn w/erythema > 2 cm from ulcer or deeper
        structures included without SIRS
    -   Severe: Local infxn with systemic inflammation as evidenced by ≥
        2 SIRS criteria

\*Consider anti-pseudomonal coverage if at risk for *Pseudomonas
aeruginosa* infection (e.g. wet; failure of prior antibiotic therapy;
chronic wound). Consider anaerobic coverage with metronidazole if
foul-smelling and/or necrotic.

Additional

Information

-   If pt HDS, hold abx until deep tissue/operative cultures obtained.
-   Most diabetic foot infections are polymicrobial in nature.
-   Many wounds colonized with MRSA and/or *Pseudomonas* improve even
    when antibiotic treatment not directed at those pathogens are
    administered.
-   Culture results may guide therapy, but all pathogens identified may
    not require treatment. Do not swab superficial swabs of the lesion.
-   Treatment is multidisciplinary and may require orthopedics,
    vascular, and/or endocrinology assessment and intervention.
