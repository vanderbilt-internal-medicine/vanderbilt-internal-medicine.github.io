# Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP)

Bailey DeCoursey

---

# Background

- Infection of ascitic fluid without evidence of a surgical intra-abdominal source
  
- Present in approximately 1/3 of patients with cirrhosis who are hospitalized
  
- Presentation: fever, abdominal pain, encephalopathy, renal failure, acidosis, and/or
leukocytosis

- Pathophysiology: Combination of GI bacterial flora overgrowth, reduced liver protein
production (low complement levels), impaired phagocytic cell function leading to inability to clear pathogens

# Evaluation

- Any pt with cirrhosis and ascites who is admitted should have diagnostic para to r/o SBP. Delaying paracentesis > 12 hours is associated with a 2.7-fold increase in mortality.
      - Obtain cell count with diff
      - Calculate the PMNs: total nucleated cells x % neutrophils.
      - PMN > 250 cells is diagnostic of SBP. If there are greater than 100k RBCs, you should correct for them: for every 250 RBCs, subtract 1 PMN
  
- A positive ascitic bacterial culture with PMN <250 is called bacterascites and asymptomatic patients with bacterascites should NOT receive antibiotics as it is likely a contaminant (however, repeat paracentesis should be performed to exclude progression to SBP). You will also frequently see culture-negative SBP (neutrocytic ascites) which SHOULD be treated (see below).


## Management

- Immediately start empiric antibiotics
     - Guidelines recommend cefotaxime IV 2gm q8 hours x 5 days, but we commonly use ceftriaxone IV 2g q24h for 5-7 days at VUMC and Nashville VA
        - Most common culprits (E. coli, Klebsiella, streptococcal species, staphylococcal species)
        - If SBP developed with recent hospital admission (90 days), recent exposure to BSA, diagnosed >48 hours of admission, or with sepsis, should give zosyn +/- vanc if prior infection or positive swab for MRSA. Daptomycin should be added with hx of VRE infection instead of vanc.
        - Finally, in patients with current or recent exposure to zosyn consider meropenem for MDR coverage.

- IV albumin 1.5 g/kg on day 1 and 1g/kg on day 3

- NSBB do not need to be discontinued in patients with SBP unless hypotensive (mean arterial pressure <65mmHg). If stopped, the timing of re-initiation is based on recovery of blood pressure

- PPI’s ↑ risk for SBP in pts with cirrhosis, and should be reviewed for appropriateness

- Repeat diagnostic paracentesis two days after antibiotics initiated
    - If <25% decrease in PMNs, antibiotics should be broadened. Consider secondary bacterial peritonitis.
 
- Prophylaxis:
    - GI bleed: ceftriaxone 1g dailyàciprofloxacin 500mg BID (preferred) or Bactrim one DS
tablet BID x 5-7 days

- Outpatient lifelong ppx, indications:
    - Prior SBP
    - Ascitic protein <1.5 AND
        - Child Pugh >9 and bilirubin >3 OR
        - Renal dysfunction (Cr >1.2, Na <130, or BUN >25)
    - Preferred: Bactrim DS tab daily or ciprofloxacin 500mg daily
    - Alternatives: cefdinir 300mg daily, Augmentin 875/125 daily

- If suspicion is high for secondary bacterial peritonitis:
    - Examine serum-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG). SBP develops in pts with portal
hypertension, defined by SAAG > 1.1 g/dL. SBP is unlikely if SAAG is < 1.1 g/dL.
    - While not particularly sensitive, an ascitic leukocyte count of 5-10k should prompt
consideration of secondary peritonitis
    - Amylase from fluid can also be helpful to point towards pancreatic ascites, while bilirubin can indicate gallbladder perforation.
    - Peritoneal fluid CEA and alkaline phosphatase can additionally help identify hollow
viscus injury.
    - Evaluate with cross-sectional imaging and surgical consultation as appropriate
    - Runyon’s Criteria to distinguish, requires 2/3 criteria below (protein, glucose, LDH)

|                 | Spontaneous          | Secondary     |
|-----------------|----------------------|---------------|
| Protein (g/dL)  | <1                   | >1          |
| Glucose (mg/dL) | ≥50                  | <50         |
| LDH (U)         | Elevated, but < 225  | >225        |
| Organisms       | 0-1                  | Polymicrobial |
