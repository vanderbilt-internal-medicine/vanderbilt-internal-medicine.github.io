# Liver Transplant (LT) Workup

Katelyn Backhaus

## Background

- Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD-Na) score: initially developed to predict survivalfollowing TIPS placement, though is now used to objectively rank patients in terms of priority for liver transplant (LT)
    - Factors in total bilirubin, creatinine, INR, and Na.
    - Exception points given for complications like HCC and hepatopulmonary syndrome
(HPS), leading to score in mid to high 20’s even if biologic MELD is low
    - Highest score lasts for 7 days
-   Listing a patient for LT is determined by a multidisciplinary transplant
  committee
    -   Acute liver failure pts take precedence over decompensated
        cirrhosis pts for LT

## Evaluation 

-   Abdominal CT (triple phase) or MRI (multiphase with contrast) to evaluate for hepatic
malignancy and vascular anatomy

- Infectious workup: TB testing, HIV, RPR, VZV, CMV, EBV, and Hepatitis A, B, and C
- 
- Cardiac evaluation:
    - If RVSP > 40mmHg on TTE, then R Heart Catheterization is indicated
      
- PFT’s, carotid US
  
- Panorex to identify dental disease; consult OMFS pending results

- Appropriate cancer screenings (CXR in all patients, CT Chest in prior/current smokers,
colonoscopy, pap smear, mammogram, and PSA if applicable)

- DEXA scan (osteoporosis in up to 55% of individuals with cirrhosis)
  
- Certification of completion of intensive outpatient program (IOP) for substance abuse
  
- Evaluation by hepatobiliary surgical team after obtaining cross sectional imaging
  
- Psychosocial evaluation (consult Psychiatry, social work)
  
- Current VUMC policy: pts should be abstinent from alcohol for no less than 3-6 months,
although exceptions may be made for early liver transplant based on a very strict protocol. Discuss exception criteria with attending if suspect patient unlikely to survive hospitalization without transplant

-   Both living and deceased donor transplants are offered at VUMC. Donor evaluation, however, cannot be started before the potential recipient is deemed a candidate. Of note, should consider possible simultaneous liver-kidney transplantation for 1) CKD <30mL/min after > 90 days of eGFR<60 or 2) AKI dependent on dialysis >8 weeks or if extensive glomerulosclerosis present.
