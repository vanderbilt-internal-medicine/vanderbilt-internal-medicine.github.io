# Portal Vein Thrombosis (PVT)

## Background

- Portal Vein Thrombosis (PVT) can worsen decompensation (i.e. variceal hemorrhage), however, worsening portal HTN -> more sluggish flow -> increased risk PVT

## Presentation

- Often identified asymptomatically on U/S, but can be identified by new or worsening decompensation of portal HTN
- Variceal hemorrhage is the most common decompensating event associated with PVT
- Intestinal ischemia (abdominal pain, hematochezia) from PVT is exceedingly rare but associated with significant morbidity and mortality

## Evaluation

- RUQ U/S with doppler
    - Once identified,  should be further assessed with triple phase CT or MRI with Gadovist contrast to exclude HCC with tumor thrombus
- Pts with newly identified PVT should undergo EGD to evaluate for high-risk varices, both for diagnostic and therapeutic considerations

- PVT in pts without cirrhosis should prompt evaluation for hypercoagulable disorders

## Management

- Start AC if acute thrombus occludes >50% of main portal vein, <50% but extends into SMV, thrombus is symptomatic, or patient is a transplant candidate (irrespective of size). Requires discussion with attending/transplant team.
    - Anticoagulation options: warfarin, LMWH, or DOAC
    - DOAC’s are safe in Childs Class A, can be used with caution in Childs B, and are contraindicated in Childs C

- Pts with chronic occlusive PVT (>6 mos) or with cavernous transformation with collaterals do not generally benefit from anticoagulation

- Pts with high-risk varices should undergo endoscopic management or be on NSBB for prophylaxis for variceal hemorrhage, as noted above

- TIPS with portal vein recanalization has recently emerged as a therapeutic modality for PVT in LT candidates to allow for anastomosis, in patient’s with chronic PVT and recurrent bleeding/refractory ascites, or in patients whom intestinal ischemia persists despite AC.

- Pts should undergo follow up intermittently with ultrasound to assess for recanalization. AC may be stopped if there is failure to recanalize.

- If pts are not candidates for AC, they'll simply be treated for complications of portal HTN
