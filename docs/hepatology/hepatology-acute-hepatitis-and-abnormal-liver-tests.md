Backgroun

d

-   Acute liver injury (ALI) = elevated aminotransferases + INR >1.5 but
    NO hepatic encephalopathy
    (HE indicates acute liver failure; see below)
-   Alcoholic hepatitis (AH), though similar, is considered a separate
    process
-   The primary abnormality in congestive hepatopathy is
    hyperbilirubinemia, with mild elevations of AST/ALT or alkaline
    phosphatase though has a variable presentation
-   R-factor
    **= (ALT/uln ALT) / (ALP/uln ALP)** ;  Objectively differentiates
    patterns below
    -   R > 5 = hepatocellular injury;   R\<2 = cholestatic injury;   R
        2-5 = mixed injury

Isolated Hyperbilirubinemia:

-   Differentiate direct vs indirect bilirubin
    -   Direct bilirubin, refer to cholestatic
    -   Indirect: Gilbert versus hemolysis (send LDH, haptoglobin, retic
        count, peripheral smear)

Consider non-hepatic causes of elevated liver chemistries

-   Thyroid disorder
-   Celiac disease
-   Tick-borne infection
-   Rhabdomyolysis, hemolysis (AST>\>ALT)
