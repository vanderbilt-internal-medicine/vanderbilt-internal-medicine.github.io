as an educational guide. Content reflects current national guidelines,
as well as practice at VUMC and the Nashville VA. The handbook is not
intended to replace more comprehensive references or guides.

Images are used sparingly, but when used are either public domain or

Please note that a great deal of the ID section of this handbook has
been drawn from guidance drafted by the ID Fellows, and published online
at the Vanderbilt antimicrobial Stewardship Program (VASP). Website:
