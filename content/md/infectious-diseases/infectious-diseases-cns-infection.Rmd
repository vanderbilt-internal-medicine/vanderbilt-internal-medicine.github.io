# CNS Infection
 
Central Nervous System Infection – VASP

Meningitis

Evaluation

-   Blood cultures prior to antibiotics if possible
-   Head CT pre-LP, only if: Immunocompromised, hx of CNS diseases
    (shunts, trauma tumors), papilledema on exam or FND, AMS, or new
    onset seizure.
-   If there is a delay in obtaining head CT or LP, DO NOT delay
    antibiotics.
-   Lumbar puncture (See Procedures Section):
    -   Opening pressure
    -   Cell count + differential
    -   Glucose
    -   Protein
    -   Bacterial culture
    -   Send an extra tube or two of CSF to the lab, if possible, to be
        frozen in case extra testing is needed (Order ‘Miscellaneous
        test’ and for test name put “Please freeze CSF in virology;”
        reference lab: VUMC, specimen type: CSF)
    -   Additional studies to consider in select pts: HSV 1, 2 PCR (NOT
        antibodies), VZV PCR, VDRL, Crypto Ag, fungal and/or AFB
        cultures, MTB PCR, West Nile Virus Ab, Enterovirus PCR,
        Histoplasma Ag, or BioFire. These should not be performed
        routinely on all patients and consult ID where management
        questions exist.
    -   If BioFire is performed, double check what is included to avoid
        sending duplicate individual tests (ie HSV, VZV, enterovirus,
        etc.)

Management

-   ANTIBIOTICS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE:
    -   Ceftriaxone 2g IV **q12h** + Vancomycin, adjusted for renal
        function
    -   Piperacillin-tazobactam **cannot** be used due to poor CNS
        penetration
    -   IV ampicillin 2g q4h for optional coverage of *Listeria* for
        immunocompromised patients, pregnant women, or age >50 (adjust
        based on renal function)
    -   IV acyclovir 10 mg/kg q8h, if suspected HSV or VZV meningitis,
        make sure to run with adequate pre-hydration with NS
    -   Consider empiric PO/IV doxycycline 100mg BID if tick-borne
        illness is suspected
-   Steroids: Based on IDSA guidelines and a recent meta-analysis,
    steroids (Dexamethasone 0.15 mg/kg q6h) should be given about 10-20
    minutes before the first dose of antibiotics, or at the same time,
    in patients with suspected bacterial meningitis. IF pneumococcus is
    isolated, continue IV steroids for 2-4 days; otherwise, can d/c
-   ID consultation:
    Duration should be guided by ID and varies based on organism
    recovered

Encephalitis

Background

-   The presence or absence of normal brain function/cognition is the
    important distinguishing clinical feature between encephalitis and
    meningitis

Evaluation

-   MRI more sensitive that CT, although imaging may or may not
    demonstrate abnormal radiographic findings in patients with
    encephalitis
-   LP – similar studies as for meningitis (see above) + BioFire MEP for
    ALL pts
-   Consider ID consult prior to LP to assess what additional tests
    should be ordered.

Management

-   Acyclovir 10mg/kg IV q8hr, consideration of antibacterial therapy if
    unable to conclusively exclude a bacterial meningitis, consideration
    of doxycycline if tick-borne infection is in the differential, and
    further treatment as guided by ID
-   ID consult is strongly encouraged for all patients with suspected
    encephalitis

Brain Abscess

Evaluation

/Management

-   Consult: Neurosurgery and ID
-   Blood Cultures, HIV testing in any patient with a brain lesion
-   Empiric antibiotics:
    -   IV Vancomycin (target trough 15 - 20 mcg/mL) + ceftriaxone 2g IV
        q12h + metronidazole 500mg IV/PO q6h
    -   If concern for extension from otitis externa, use an
        antipseudomonal cephalosporin (cefepime 2g IV Q8h) instead of
        ceftriaxone
    -   Brain abscesses generally polymicrobial, thus broad-spectrum
        antibiotics indicated
-   Aminoglycosides, macrolides, tetracyclines (e.g. doxycycline),
    clindamycin, beta-lactam/beta-lactamase combinations (e.g., Zosyn)
    and 1 <sup>st</sup> -generation cephalosporins (e.g., cefazolin)
    should NOT be used as they do not cross BBB at high concentration.
-   Antibiotic Duration: Based on surgical drainage and Infe
    ctious Diseases guidance

Epidural Abscess

Management

-   If spinal lesion, consult ‘Spine surgery’ and it will be directed to
    Ortho-Spine or Neurosurgery, depending on who is on call.
-   Antibiotics should be started as soon as the diagnosis of epidural
    abscess is suspected, immediately following the collection of two
    sets of blood cultures
    -   Vancomycin 15-20mg/kg IV q8-12h (adjusted for renal function) +
        ceftriaxone 2g IV q24h (or q12hr if there is secondary
        meningitis)
    -   Use cefepime 2g IV q8h instead of ceftriaxone if concern for
        Pseudomonas
-   ID consult is strongly encouraged and they will guide duration
