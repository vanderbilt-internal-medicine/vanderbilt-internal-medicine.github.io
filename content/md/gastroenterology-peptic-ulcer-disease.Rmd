# Peptic Ulcer Disease
 
Peptic Ulcer Disease – Michelle Izmaylov

Background

-   Ulceration in the GI tract wall extending through the muscularis
    mucosa into deeper layers
-   Most common in the stomach and proximal duodenum
-   Less common in the lower esophagus, the distal duodenum, or the
    jejunum
    -   ↑
        suspicion for unopposed hypersecretory states, like
        Zollinger-Ellison syndrome
    -   Causes: NSAID use and Helicobacter pylori >\> steroids,
        malignancy and acute stress

Presentation

-   Episodic gnawing or burning epigastric pain, 2 - 5 hr after meals,
    nausea, vomiting, heartburn, bloating, postprandial belching, and
    loss of appetite
-   Nocturnal pain: acid is secreted in absence of a food buffer
-   Classic teaching for ulcers:
    Gastric (pain worse w/eating); Duodenal (pain better w/eating)
-   May be asymptomatic until complications such as hemorrhage or
    perforation
-   Alarm features
    : unintentional weight loss, persistent vomiting, melena,
    progressive dysphagia, early satiety, recurrent vomiting, palpable
    abdominal mass, lymphadenopathy, family history of upper
    gastrointestinal cancer, and iron deficiency anemia

Evaluation

-   CBC
-   H Pylori testing: if no strong NSAID use history
    -   Urea breath or stool antigen (pt needs to d/c PPI for 1-2 weeks,
        to avoid false - for both)
-   EGD: if alarm features or patient is older than 55

Management

-   General: treat underlying cause (i.e. H. pylori, stop NSAIDs, etc),
    encourage smoking cessation, and limit alcohol intake to 1
    drink/day.
-   If complicated peptic ulcer (i.e. bleeding, perforation, or gastric
    outlet obstruction):
    -   IV PPI (if bleeding, cont IV PPI for 72 hrs after endoscopic
        treatment then -->  oral PPI )
    -   EGD to determine etiology and for possible treatment
    -   Repeat EGD if indicated (see below)
-   If uncomplicated peptic ulcer (not caused by H. pylori):
    -   Antisecretory therapy with oral PPI (i.e. omeprazole 20 to 40 mg
        daily):
        -   If caused by NSAIDs: Duration: \<1 cm ulcer
            
            4-6 wks; ≥1 cm ulcer
            
            6-8 wks
        -   If not caused by NSAIDs, Duration:
            -   Duodenal ulcer: 4 weeks
            -   Gastric ulcer: 8 weeks
            -   Evaluate for other etiologies
-   If ulcer caused by H. pylori:
    -   Treat with PPI BID for 14 days with an appropriate combination
        antibiotic regimen.
    -   Confirm H. pylori eradication (via stool antigen test, urease
        breath test, or EGD >4 weeks after compl
        etion of therapy). If not eradicated, retreat

Additional Information

-   -   -   

-   Continue maintenance PPI therapy (omeprazole 20 mg daily) for the
    following:
    -   Peptic ulcer >2 cm and age >50 or multiple co-morbidities
    -   Frequently recurrent peptic ulcers (>2 in one year)
    -   H. pylori-negative, NSAID-negative ulcer disease
    -   Failure to eradicate H. pylori (including salvage therapy)
    -   Condition requiring long term aspirin/NSAID use
    -   Persistent ulcer on repeat EGD (if performed)

-   -   -   

-   Indications for repeat EGD (8-12 weeks):
    -   Persistent/recurrent sxs despite medical therapy
    -   Complicated ulcer (bleeding), with evidence of ongoing bleeding
    -   Giant gastric ulcer (>2 cm) or features of malignancy at index
        endoscopy
    -   Gastric ulcer that was not biopsied or inadequately sampled on
        initial EGD
    -   Gastric ulcer in pt w/risk factors for gastric cancer (>50
        yo, H. pylori, immigrant from high prevalence area \[Japan,
        Korea, Taiwan, Costa Rica\], FHx, presence of gastric atrophy,
        adenoma, dysplasia, intestinal metaplasia)
