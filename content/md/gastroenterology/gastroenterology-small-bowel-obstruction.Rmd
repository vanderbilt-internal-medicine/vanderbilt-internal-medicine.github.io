# Small Bowel Obstruction
 
Small Bowel Obstruction (SBO) – Alex Wiles

Background

-   
-   Risk Factors: prior abdominal surgeries (adhesions), malignancy,
    hernia, intestinal inflammation (IBD)/stricture, radiation, abscess,
    foreign bodies
-   Indicators for bowel ischemia: fever, leukocytosis, tachycardia,
    peritonitis
-   Ddx: early appendicitis, large bowel obstruction, Ogilvie’s, DKA,
    Pancreatitis, IBD, Gastric outlet obstruction

Presentation

-   
-   Nausea, Emesis, intermittent colic, bloating, constipation
-   Obstipation if completely obstructed, loss of flatulence
-   Exam: classically with “tinkling” bowel sounds, tympanic abdomen,
    distended abdomen

Evaluation

-   
-   CBC, BMP, lipase, hepatic function panel, lactate (sensitive, not
    specific for ischemia)
-   Start with KUB to r/o perforation but typically will require CT
    (x-ray only \~80% sensitive)
-   CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast is optimal study if adequate
    renal function
    -   No oral contrast (American College of Radiology (ACR)
        Appropriateness Criteria) as it will not aid diagnosis and can
        lead to aspiration; IV helps evaluate ischemia
    -   Key word: transition point
    -   Non-specific signs of bowel inflammation: bowel wall thickening,
        submucosal edema

Management

-   
-   Use Small Bowel Obstruction admission order set (surgery order set)
-   Consult EGS: if any concern for SBO,  evaluate need for urgent
    surgery
    -   Surgical indications
        
        complete obstruction, CT with ischemia, perforation
-   Gastric decompression: place NGT (prevent aspiration)
-   NPO until obstruction relieved and NGT removed
-   Fluids: two large bore IVs (nursing communication); LR bolus +
    maintenance while NPO
-   If no resolution of partial obstruction at 48 hours:
    -   Fluoroscopy Upper GI small bowel ft (follow through)
        -   In comments, write “Gastrografin contrast” (water-soluble
            contrast) which osmotically reduces bowel wall edema and
            aids peristalsis
        -   If gastrografin reaches the colon within 24 hours, it
            predicts clinical resolution of SBO without surgery
        -   Note this can also be therapeutic for pSBO and get bowels
            moving
-   Signs of resolution of SBO:
    -   Decrease in the volume of nasogastric tube output
    -   Decrease in abdominal distension or passage of flatus/stool per
        rectum
